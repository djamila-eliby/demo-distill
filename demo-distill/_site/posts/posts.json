Please consult a dietitian or health care\r\npractitioner if you have any concerns.\r\nWe all know that we have to eat healthily to maintain our optimal\r\nphysical health, and now we are beginning to understand that it’s\r\nimportant for our mental health too. But what exactly does healthy\r\neating look like? The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a healthy\r\ndiet as the intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes (which include\r\nbeans and lentils), nuts, and whole grains (unrefined grains including\r\noats, wheat, and brown rice).\r\nOther great sources for evidence-based information on healthy eating\r\nare country-specific dietary guidelines. These nutritional guidelines\r\nare developed by governmental institutions and are aimed at educating\r\nthe general public on how to eat for optimal health, and to prevent\r\nchronic non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes,\r\ncardiovascular diseases, and cancers. An important caveat is that these\r\neducational tools are not developed with every individual in mind, which\r\nmeans that certain groups of people may need special dietary advice\r\n(e.g., those with a medical condition, or the frail elderly).\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the most recent Dietary Guidelines\r\nwere published in 2013 and are centered around 5 key principles:\r\n1. Physical activity and choosing enough nutritious food and\r\ndrinks to meet your energy needs for achieving and maintaining a healthy\r\nweight\r\n2. Enjoying a wide variety of nutritious foods daily from the\r\nfive key food groups: vegetables, fruit, grains, lean animal- and\r\nplant-derived protein, and mostly fat-reduced dairy products\r\n3. Limiting the consumption of discretionary foods containing\r\nexcess saturated fat, salt, and sugar, as well as alcohol\r\n4. Encouraging, supporting, and promoting breastfeeding\r\n5. Caring for your food, which including preparing and storing it\r\nsafely\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nMore detailed information about each of the different food\r\ngroups and recommended serving sizes according to age and sex can be\r\nfound here.\r\nImage credit: Brooke Lark on Unsplash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan what we eat really improve our mood?\r\nThis is the question that a relatively new field of research is\r\ntrying to investigate. Nutritional psychiatry tries to understand how\r\noverall dietary patterns - as well as specific foods or food groups -\r\ninfluence our overall mental and brain health1. And while most of the existing\r\nevidence so far is observational - meaning, we cannot draw any causal\r\ninferences from their results - there is a consistent trend for healthy\r\ndiets protecting against the risk of depressive symptoms over time2.\r\nUnhealthy diets, on the other hand, may increase our risk for\r\ndepression, although the evidence for this is still rather mixed3.\r\nThere are also a growing number of randomised controlled trials,\r\nwhich is the strongest form of evidence for cause and effect, showing\r\nthat adhering to healthy diets can improve symptoms of depression in the\r\ngeneral population4 as well\r\nas in individuals with more severe forms of depression5. However, we still have a long\r\nway to go before we can definitively prescribe particular diets to\r\npeople with diagnosed depression. For instance, we are currently still\r\nin the process of understanding how exactly diet may confer\r\neffects on our mental health, which will be the topic of a separate blog\r\npost. Associations with anxiety are also much less researched, even\r\nthough anxiety and depression often co-occur at very high rates!\r\nUnderstanding what exactly is meant by a healthy diet is also an\r\nimportant factor to consider, as we are often bombarded by lots of\r\ninformation in mainstream media about the latest diet fads, juice\r\ncleanses, and detox diets. Which sources are evidence-based and which\r\nare just social media hype?
