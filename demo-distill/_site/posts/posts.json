Nutritional Psychiatry tries to understand how\r\noverall dietary patterns - as well as specific foods or food groups -\r\ninfluence our overall mental and brain health (Sarris 2019). And while most of the\r\nexisting evidence so far is observational - meaning, we cannot draw any\r\ncausal inferences from their results - there is a consistent trend for\r\nhealthy diets protecting against the risk of depressive symptoms over\r\ntime (Lassale et al.\r\n2018). Unhealthy diets, on the other hand, may\r\nincrease our risk for depression\r\nThere are also a growing number of randomised controlled trials,\r\nwhich is the strongest form of evidence for cause and effect, showing\r\nthat adhering to healthy diets can improve symptoms of depression in the\r\ngeneral population (Firth et al.\r\n2019) as well as in individuals with more severe forms of\r\ndepression (Jacka et al.\r\n2017). However, we still have a long way to go before we can\r\ndefinitively prescribe particular diets to people with diagnosed\r\ndepression. For instance, we are currently still in the process of\r\nunderstanding how exactly diet may confer effects on our mental\r\nhealth, which will be the topic of a separate blog post. Associations\r\nwith anxiety are also much less researched, even though anxiety and\r\ndepression often co-occur at very high rates!\r\nUnderstanding what exactly is meant by a healthy diet is also an\r\nimportant factor to consider, as we are often bombarded by lots of\r\ninformation in mainstream media about the latest diet fads, juice\r\ncleanses, and detox diets. Which sources are evidence-based and which\r\nare just social media hype? In the next blog post we will more closely\r\nexamine the concept of healthy eating and examine some well-established\r\ndietary patterns that are based on rigorous epidemiological\r\nevidence.\r\nImage credit: Brooke Lark on Unsplash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirth, Joseph, Wolfgang Marx, Sarah Dash, Rebekah Carney, Scott B.\r\nTeasdale, Marco Solmi, Brendon Stubbs, et al. 2019. “The Effects of Dietary Improvement on Symptoms of\r\nDepression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled\r\nTrials.” Psychosomatic Medicine 81 (3): 265–80.\r\nhttps://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000673.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacka, Felice N., Adrienne O’Neil, Rachelle Opie, Catherine Itsiopoulos,\r\nSue Cotton, Mohammedreza Mohebbi, David Castle, et al. 2017.\r\n“A randomised controlled trial of dietary\r\nimprovement for adults with major depression (the ‘SMILES’\r\ntrial).” BMC Medicine 15 (1): 1–14. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-017-0791-y.\r\n\r\n\r\nLassale, Camille, G.
