    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan what we eat really improve our mood?\r\nThis is the question that a relatively new field of research is\r\ntrying to investigate. Nutritional Psychiatry tries to understand how\r\noverall dietary patterns - as well as specific foods or food groups -\r\ninfluence our overall mental and brain health1. And while most of the existing\r\nevidence so far is observational - meaning, we cannot draw any causal\r\ninferences from their results - there is a consistent trend for healthy\r\ndiets protecting against the risk of depressive symptoms over time2.\r\nUnhealthy diets, on the other hand, may increase our risk for\r\ndepression, although the evidence for this is still rather mixed3.\r\nThere are also a growing number of randomised controlled trials,\r\nwhich is the strongest form of evidence for cause and effect, showing\r\nthat adhering to healthy diets can improve symptoms of depression in the\r\ngeneral population4 as well\r\nas in individuals with more severe forms of depression5. However, we still have a long\r\nway to go before we can definitively prescribe particular diets to\r\npeople with diagnosed depression. For instance, we are currently still\r\nin the process of understanding how exactly diet may confer\r\neffects on our mental health, which will be the topic of a separate blog\r\npost. Associations with anxiety are also much less researched, even\r\nthough anxiety and depression often co-occur at very high rates!\r\nUnderstanding what exactly is meant by a healthy diet is also an\r\nimportant factor to consider, as we are often bombarded by lots of\r\ninformation in mainstream media about the latest diet fads, juice\r\ncleanses, and detox diets. Which sources are evidence-based and which\r\nare just social media hype?
