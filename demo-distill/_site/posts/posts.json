A diet that claims to\r\ncleanse and detox your body in the hopes of supporting your overall\r\nhealth. And on and on the list goes…\r\nExamples of popular (and controversial) fad diets in the past:\r\nRaw Foods Diet\r\nAlkaline Diet\r\nCabbage Soup Diet\r\nSubway Diet\r\nWhile fad diets often gain lots of popularity and traction with the\r\ngeneral public because they offer a quick and easy fix to various health\r\nconcerns, they are generally not based on any solid empirical evidence.\r\nAnd what’s more, these types of diets could even be potentially harmful\r\nbecause they often cut out whole food groups or restrict caloric intake\r\nand other important nutrients (e.g. juice diet). If you need a reminder\r\nof what a well-balanced daily intake of the core food groups looks like,\r\nthen check out this food\r\nselection guide provided by the Australian dietary guidelines.\r\nSo how can you stay informed and look out for fad diet promises? For\r\none, fad diets or any kind of ‘miracle’ supplements or products are\r\noften endorsed by celebrities, influencers, and other organisations that\r\nhave no qualification in dietetics or nutrition. Their claims are also\r\ntypically accompanied by emotionally-laden or dramatic statements that\r\nare refuted by the scientific community - such as strong recommendations\r\nmade from the conclusions of a single study. If you ever have the\r\nfeeling like something sounds too good to be true, it most likely is!\r\nSpeak to a dietician/nutritionist or other health care professional if\r\nyou ever have any doubt.\r\nImage credit: Diana Polekhina on Unsplash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Look no\r\nfurther!\r\nThis delicious, nutrient-dense, and budget-friendly meal is how I\r\nstart every single day. It helps to keep me full and gives me a slow but\r\nsteady release of energy throughout the morning. Oats are a great source\r\nof dietary fibres and other bioactive compounds that have been linked to\r\nnumerous\r\nhealth benefits, such as lowering cholesterol and reducing the blood\r\nglucose response after eating. Also, the soluble fibre in oats (called\r\nbeta-glucans) have prebiotic effects, which means they help to feed the\r\nbeneficial microbes in the gut.\r\nThe blueberries in this recipe pack a further punch with their\r\nbeneficial phytochemical\r\nproperties and heavy anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.\r\nFinally, the walnuts and chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids\r\n(among other minerals and fibres) which are involved in a wide range of\r\nimportant processes related to the growth\r\nand functioning of our brain, as well as to maintain healthy\r\ncognition and mood. So, there’s no reason not to tuck in!\r\nIngredients:\r\n1/4 cup rolled oats\r\n1/4 cup quick oats\r\n1/4 tsp ground cinnamon\r\n1/4 cup frozen (or fresh) blueberries\r\n2/3 cup milk of choice (e.g., dairy, soy, oat milk)\r\n1/2 tsp chia seeds\r\nHandful of walnuts\r\nSteps:\r\nCombine the rolled oats, quick oats, blueberries (if frozen), and\r\ncinnamon in a microwave safe bowl\r\nAdd the milk and stir in well\r\nMicrowave on a high setting (800-1000W) for 1.5 - 2 minutes\r\nStir well and sprinkle on chia seeds and walnuts on top (and if\r\nusing fresh blueberries, add at this point)\r\nEnjoy!\r\nNote. If you like your porridge to be a bit sweeter, add in a\r\nsweetener of choice, like a drizzle of honey or sprinkle of stevia. Also\r\nfeel free to swap out the blueberries and walnuts for another berry or\r\nnut to keep it interesting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Please consult a dietitian or health care\r\npractitioner if you have any concerns.\r\nWe all know that we have to eat healthily to maintain our optimal\r\nphysical health, and now we are beginning to understand that it’s\r\nimportant for our mental health too. But what exactly does healthy\r\neating look like? The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a healthy\r\ndiet as the intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes (which include\r\nbeans and lentils), nuts, and whole grains (unrefined grains including\r\noats, wheat, and brown rice).\r\nOther great sources for evidence-based information on healthy eating\r\nare country-specific dietary guidelines. These nutritional guidelines\r\nare developed by governmental institutions and are aimed at educating\r\nthe general public on how to eat for optimal health, and to prevent\r\nchronic non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes,\r\ncardiovascular diseases, and cancers. An important caveat is that these\r\neducational tools are not developed with every individual in mind, which\r\nmeans that certain groups of people may need special dietary advice\r\n(e.g., those with a medical condition, or the frail elderly).\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the most recent Dietary Guidelines\r\nwere published in 2013 and are centered around 5 key principles:\r\n1. Physical activity and choosing enough nutritious food and\r\ndrinks to meet your energy needs for achieving and maintaining a healthy\r\nweight\r\n2. Enjoying a wide variety of nutritious foods daily from the\r\nfive key food groups: vegetables, fruit, grains, lean animal- and\r\nplant-derived protein, and mostly fat-reduced dairy products\r\n3. Limiting the consumption of discretionary foods containing\r\nexcess saturated fat, salt, and sugar, as well as alcohol\r\n4. Encouraging, supporting, and promoting breastfeeding\r\n5. Caring for your food, which including preparing and storing it\r\nsafely\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nMore detailed information about each of the different food\r\ngroups and recommended serving sizes according to age and sex can be\r\nfound here.\r\nImage credit: Brooke Lark on Unsplash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan what we eat really improve our mood?\r\nThis is the question that a relatively new field of research is\r\ntrying to investigate. Nutritional psychiatry tries to understand how\r\noverall dietary patterns - as well as specific foods or food groups -\r\ninfluence our overall mental and brain health1. And while most of the existing\r\nevidence so far is observational - meaning, we cannot draw any causal\r\ninferences from their results - there is a consistent trend for healthy\r\ndiets protecting against the risk of depressive symptoms over time2.\r\nUnhealthy diets, on the other hand, may increase our risk for\r\ndepression, although the evidence for this is still rather mixed3.\r\nThere are also a growing number of randomised controlled trials,\r\nwhich is the strongest form of evidence for cause and effect, showing\r\nthat adhering to healthy diets can improve symptoms of depression in the\r\ngeneral population4 as well\r\nas in individuals with more severe forms of depression5. However, we still have a long\r\nway to go before we can definitively prescribe particular diets to\r\npeople with diagnosed depression. For instance, we are currently still\r\nin the process of understanding how exactly diet may confer\r\neffects on our mental health, which will be the topic of a separate blog\r\npost. Associations with anxiety are also much less researched, even\r\nthough anxiety and depression often co-occur at very high rates!\r\nUnderstanding what exactly is meant by a healthy diet is also an\r\nimportant factor to consider, as we are often bombarded by lots of\r\ninformation in mainstream media about the latest diet fads, juice\r\ncleanses, and detox diets. Which sources are evidence-based and which\r\nare just social media hype?
