This recipe was\r\nactually inspired from a meal kit card that I had some time ago - but I\r\nmodified it to make it my own. This version packs even more veggies and\r\nflavours and has been a staple go-to-lunch for me, especially in the\r\nwarmer months.\r\nFalafel is a popular Middle Eastern dish made of spiced mashed\r\nchickpeas or other pulses that are formed into balls or fritters and\r\nusually deep fried - although I personally prefer to bake or airfry my\r\nfalafel which is not only healthier but still\r\nachieves that same delicious crispiness. Falafel is high in dietary\r\nfibre and plant-based protein and contains other beneficial minerals\r\nsuch as phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron -\r\nmaking it a fast-food that packs a punch above the rest!\r\nIngredients for four servings:\r\n1 packet of ready-to-eat falafel\r\n100 g couscous\r\n1 red onion, 1 red capsicum, 1 sweet potato (but feel free to mix up\r\nthese veggies with pumpkin, zucchini, eggplant, etc. and adjust roasting\r\ntime as needed)\r\nMixed leaves (spinach, rocket, etc.)\r\nOlive oil\r\nLemon juice\r\nGreek yogurt\r\nSalt and pepper\r\nCapers (optional)\r\nSteps:\r\nPre-heat oven (fan forced) to 180 degrees Celsius.\r\nMeanwhile, cut up the onion, capsicum, and sweet potato into small\r\nbite-size pieces, place onto a baking tray, and toss together with a\r\ndrizzle of olive oil and salt/pepper.\r\nOnce the oven is pre-heated, roast veggies for about 20 minutes or\r\nuntil they can be easily skewered with a fork.\r\nPlace falafel onto another baking tray and place into the oven for\r\nabout 10 minutes (alternatively, place into an airfyer instead)\r\nWhile the veggies/falafel are roasting away, place couscous into a\r\nsmall pot and add 150 mL of boiling water, combining well, and then let\r\nit rest for about 5 minutes with the cover on. After 5 minutes, fluff up\r\nwith a fork and add a bit of olive oil to taste. Set aside.\r\nOnce the vegetables and falafel are ready, toss veggies into the pot\r\nof couscous and combine well, adding a dash of lemon juice and some\r\nsalt/pepper.\r\nIn a big bowl, lay down a layer of mixed leaves and spoon on a\r\nquarter of the couscous mixture. Place 3-4 falafel on top, drizzle over\r\nsome greek yogurt, and sprinkle with some capers for garnish. I also\r\nsometimes like to add a dollop of hummus at the end for some extra\r\ncreaminess and flavour - it goes really well together~\r\nMix well and enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

What’s exciting is that the science is now catching\r\nup and starting to reveal that there is a lot more substance to this\r\nphrase than we may have initially thought.\r\nApart from being an abundant source of vitamins and minerals, fruit\r\nand vegetables (as well as legumes, grains, and even spices) contain\r\nbioactive compounds known as phytonutrients (also referred to\r\nas phytochemicals)1. Phytonutrients are chemical\r\ncompounds produced by plants to help them resist microbes (such as\r\nbacteria and fungi), prevent them from being eaten by insects and other\r\nanimals, and to help them against the natural elements. Exactly these\r\ninnate plant defence mechanisms are thought to confer benefits for human\r\nhealth, and they are what give plants their vibrant colours and\r\ndistinctive tastes and smells.\r\nA recent umbrella review (in other words, a mega review of\r\nexisting reviews) found that over 40% of the investigated health\r\noutcomes were improved by the intake of phytonutrients, ranging from\r\nbody weight, lipid profile, inflammation - and even cancer.2. This\r\nstudy also highlights the importance of eating a variety of\r\nplant foods so that you can maximise the intake of a range of beneficial\r\nphytonutrients. For instance, the phytonutrient lycopene is commonly\r\nfound in fruit and vegetables with bright reds, purples, and blues\r\n(think grapes, tomatoes, and purple cabbage) and has been linked with\r\nimproved risk for all-cause mortality, stroke, and inflammatory markers.\r\nOn the other hand, beta-carotene (found in yellow and orange plants such\r\nas carrots, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe) is not only known to be good for\r\nvision and eye health but is also associated with lower risk for breast\r\nand gastric cancers.2. While all of the known links\r\nhave so far only been investigated in relation to physical health, it\r\nwill be important to understand how phytonutrients may be related to\r\nbrain and mental health - an important area for future study.\r\nIn a future post, we’ll delve more into the details around the\r\nwell-studied phytonutrients and their specific health properties, as\r\nwell as practical tips on how to diversify the colours on your plate. In\r\nthe meantime, I recommend checking out this handy\r\nguide on the ins and outs of phytonutrients provided by the\r\nInstitute for Functional Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Minich DM.

Papaya is one of my\r\nfavourite tropical fruits - not only is it delicious, but it packs a\r\nheavy punch in terms of its nutritional properties! Rich in vitamins A,\r\nC, and E, and a number of beneficial phytochemicals (chemical compounds\r\nproduced by plants)1, papaya\r\nconsumption has been linked to various health benefits, including\r\ndigestive and immune modulation.2\r\nSpeaking of digestion - some types of yogurt containing live, active\r\ncultures may be beneficial for your gut health! Research has shown that\r\nregular consumption of yogurt and other fermented foods containing\r\nbeneficial strains, such as Bifidobacteria and\r\nLactobacillus, is associated with improved intestinal and\r\nextraintestinal health3. Yogurt is also rich in calcium,\r\nvarious B vitamins, and other trace minerals that are important for\r\nhealth - just beware of yogurts that are laden with too much sugar!\r\nLastly, adding a handful of nuts and seeds on your papaya bowl will\r\nadd a generous serving of protein, healthy fats, fibre, and beneficial\r\nmicronutrients. Nuts and seeds also help to keep us fuller for longer -\r\nmeaning that they can help with weight\r\nregulation and protect against various chronic diseases.\r\nIngredients for one serving:\r\nHalf a ripe papaya\r\n3/4 cup of natural yogurt\r\nHandful of nuts (e.g. walnuts, almonds, macadamias) and seeds\r\n(e.g. chia, flax seeds, or pumpkin seeds) - experiment with this and\r\ndiversify! The more variety, the better! :)\r\nSteps:\r\nCut the papaya in half (length wise) and scoop out the seeds if you\r\nwish (technically, the seeds are edible and have even been linked to\r\nsome health\r\nbenefits - but they are bitter)\r\nSpoon the yogurt into the papaya and sprinkle with your selection of\r\nnuts and seeds\r\nOptional - add a drizzle of honey or your choice of sweetener if you\r\nhave a bit of a sweet tooth (like me)\r\nDig in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCookies. Chips. Instant noodles. Sweets. Sodas. Sweet breads…what do\r\nall these foods have in common?\r\nThe first thing that probably comes to mind is the fact that these\r\nare foods which should be eaten in moderation, in line with the\r\nprinciples set out by the Australian\r\ndietary guidelines. This is because discretionary foods are\r\ntypically high in sugar, saturated and trans fats, salt, and/or alcohol\r\n- often displacing more nutritious foods and resulting in a\r\nnutritionally deficient diet.1 However, beyond this, they are\r\nalso classified as Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs) which are defined by the\r\nNOVA food classification system as:\r\n“Ready-to-consume\r\nindustrial formulations of homogenised cheap ingredients obtained from\r\nhigh-yield crops, notably sugars and syrups, refined starches, oils and\r\nfats, protein isolates, and also sometimes from remnants of intensively\r\nreared animals. Such formulations are made to look, smell, and taste\r\ngood or often irresistible, by use of sophisticated combinations of\r\nflavours, colours, emulsifiers, sweeteners, thickeners and other\r\nadditives that have a cosmetic function”1\r\nThe consumption of UPFs has skyrocketed in the last several decades\r\nand has coincided with a trend towards diets that are associated with\r\nhigher rates of obesity and non-communicable diseases all around the\r\nworld.2 What’s\r\nmore, rather than simply displacing healthy food intake, UPFs seem to\r\nhave a direct effect on health-related outcomes3, including mental health\r\nrisk.4 Beyond the\r\nunhealthy properties of UPFs, what makes these foods particularly\r\ndetrimental is the fact that they contain little to no intact food, are\r\nvery energy-dense, typically have high glycemic loads, and can be\r\nformulated to be quasi-addictive.1\r\nSo how can you spot an ultra-processed food? Firstly, fresh\r\nvegetables, fruit, starchy roots and tubers, pasteurised milk and\r\nchilled meat (as well as various plant oils, sugar, and salt) are not\r\nultra-processed.1\r\nSecondly, an easy way to identify if something is ultra-processed is by\r\nhow it is packaged and if the ingredients list contains at least one\r\nitem that would not ordinarily be used in a kitchen or classes of\r\nadditives which include flavours, flavour enhancers, colours,\r\nemulsifiers, sweeteners, and thickeners. To find out more about\r\nadditives, see these further resources for the US\r\nand Australia.\r\nImage credit: Fikri Rasyid on Unsplash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

A very simple, quick, and nutritious lunch or dinner that\r\ncontains a serving of salmon, buckwheat soba noodles, and plenty of\r\ngreens!\r\nSalmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and various essential\r\nminerals and vitamins that are health-promoting. These omega-3 fats,\r\nwhich we can only get from our diet, have not only been linked to better\r\ninflammatory and cardio-metabolic outcomes, but are also increasingly\r\nlinked to clinical benefits in depression.1,2 And a top tip - if you can leave\r\nthe salmon skin on, then you’ll be getting the highest\r\nconcentration of omega-3s!\r\nThis recipe also includes a variety of veggies - such as broccoli,\r\ncauliflower, and asparagus (but these can be substituted for any other\r\nveg that you prefer) - which are not only high in dietary fibre and\r\nmicronutrients, but may also protect against depression.3,4 You can opt\r\nfor fresh produce or frozen vegetables - they are both equally\r\nas nutritious, and frozen veggies are sometimes even more\r\nnutrient-dense because they are picked at their peak ripeness. It can\r\nalso help with reducing food wastage and is generally friendlier on the\r\nwallet. Win-win!\r\nIngredients for two servings:\r\n2 salmon fillets (skin on)\r\n180 g buckwheat soba noodles\r\n2 cups veggies of choice: broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, etc.\r\n(fresh or frozen)\r\nHomemade teriyaki sauce (following this recipe - it\r\nonly takes 5 minutes!)\r\nCorn flour\r\nOlive oil\r\nSesame seeds to garnish (optional)\r\nSteps:\r\nPrepare the teriyaki sauce as outlined above (or, if you prefer, you\r\ncan of course purchase a ready-made bottled version - but I would\r\nrecommend looking at the amount of salt/sugar in some of these, they can\r\nsometimes be exceedingly high!).\r\nMeanwhile, dust the salmon fillets with a light layer of corn flour\r\non all sides.\r\nPre-heat a shallow frying pan with a few table spoons of oil over a\r\nmedium heat, and pan fry salmon fillets on each side for 2-3 minutes\r\ndepending on how well done you like your salmon. Set aside once cooked\r\nto your liking.\r\nPrepare a pot of water and gently bring up to the boil.\r\nPrepare your veggies - if using fresh produce, I like to cut the\r\nveggies into bite-size pieces and either steam or gently fry on a low\r\nheat. If frozen, I either defrost the veggies in the microwave or heat\r\nthem up on the pan in some of the teriyaki sauce (read on for this\r\nstep).\r\nWhile the veggies are being cooked, prepare the soda noodles in the\r\nlarge pot of boiling water (no need to add extra salt to the water, as\r\nthe soda noodles are already salted) as per packet instructions. Drain\r\nand rinse in some cold water once cooked so that the noodles don’t stick\r\ntogether. Set aside.\r\nHeat up about 3/4 cup of the terikyaki sauce in a shallow pan and\r\nplace the salmon fillets in the sauce so that they are evenly coated.\r\nDuring this step, I also like to add the frozen vegetables so that they\r\nheat up at the same time and are coated in the teriyaki sauce.\r\nOnce the veggies are done, plate everything up - one piece of\r\nsalmon, a serving of soba noodles and veggies, and a light drizzle of\r\nthe teriyaki sauce over the noodles.\r\nSprinkle with some sesame seeds and enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Please consult a dietitian or health care\r\npractitioner if you have any concerns.\r\nWe all know that we have to eat healthily to maintain our optimal\r\nphysical health, and now we are beginning to understand that it’s\r\nimportant for our mental health too. But what exactly does healthy\r\neating look like? The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a healthy\r\ndiet as the intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes (which include\r\nbeans and lentils), nuts, and whole grains (unrefined grains including\r\noats, wheat, and brown rice).\r\nOther great sources for evidence-based information on healthy eating\r\nare country-specific dietary guidelines. These nutritional guidelines\r\nare developed by governmental institutions and are aimed at educating\r\nthe general public on how to eat for optimal health, and to prevent\r\nchronic non-communicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes,\r\ncardiovascular diseases, and cancers. An important caveat is that these\r\neducational tools are not developed with every individual in mind, which\r\nmeans that certain groups of people may need special dietary advice\r\n(e.g., those with a medical condition, or the frail elderly).\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nIn Australia, the most recent Dietary Guidelines\r\nwere published in 2013 and are centered around 5 key principles:\r\n1. Physical activity and choosing enough nutritious food and\r\ndrinks to meet your energy needs for achieving and maintaining a healthy\r\nweight\r\n2. Enjoying a wide variety of nutritious foods daily from the\r\nfive key food groups: vegetables, fruit, grains, lean animal- and\r\nplant-derived protein, and mostly fat-reduced dairy products\r\n3. Limiting the consumption of discretionary foods containing\r\nexcess saturated fat, salt, and sugar, as well as alcohol\r\n4. Encouraging, supporting, and promoting breastfeeding\r\n5. Caring for your food, which including preparing and storing it\r\nsafely\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nMore detailed information about each of the different food\r\ngroups and recommended serving sizes according to age and sex can be\r\nfound here.\r\nImage credit: Brooke Lark on Unsplash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan what we eat really improve our mood?\r\nThis is the question that a relatively new field of research is\r\ntrying to investigate. Nutritional psychiatry tries to understand how\r\noverall dietary patterns - as well as specific foods or food groups -\r\ninfluence our overall mental and brain health1. And while most of the existing\r\nevidence so far is observational - meaning, we cannot draw any causal\r\ninferences from their results - there is a consistent trend for healthy\r\ndiets protecting against the risk of depressive symptoms over time2.\r\nUnhealthy diets, on the other hand, may increase our risk for\r\ndepression, although the evidence for this is still rather mixed3.\r\nThere are also a growing number of randomised controlled trials,\r\nwhich is the strongest form of evidence for cause and effect, showing\r\nthat adhering to healthy diets can improve symptoms of depression in the\r\ngeneral population4 as well\r\nas in individuals with more severe forms of depression5. However, we still have a long\r\nway to go before we can definitively prescribe particular diets to\r\npeople with diagnosed depression. For instance, we are currently still\r\nin the process of understanding how exactly diet may confer\r\neffects on our mental health, which will be the topic of a separate blog\r\npost. Associations with anxiety are also much less researched, even\r\nthough anxiety and depression often co-occur at very high rates!\r\nUnderstanding what exactly is meant by a healthy diet is also an\r\nimportant factor to consider, as we are often bombarded by lots of\r\ninformation in mainstream media about the latest diet fads, juice\r\ncleanses, and detox diets. Which sources are evidence-based and which\r\nare just social media hype?
