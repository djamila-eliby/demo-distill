Papaya is one of my\r\nfavourite tropical fruits - not only is it delicous, but it packs a\r\nheavy punch in terms of its nutritional properties! Rich in Vitamins A,\r\nC, and E, and a number of beneficial phytochemicals (i.e., chemical\r\ncompounds produced by plants)1, papaya consumption has been\r\nlinked to various health benefits, including digestive and immune\r\nmodulation.2\r\nSpeaking of digestion - some types of yogurt containing live, active\r\ncultures may be beneficial for your gut health! Research has shown that\r\nregular consumption of yogurt and other fermented foods containing\r\nbeneficial strains, such as Bifidobacteria and\r\nLactobacillus, is associated with improved intestinal and\r\nextraintestinal health3. Yogurt is also rich in calcium,\r\nvarious B vitamins, and other trace minerals that are important for\r\nhealth - just beware of yogurts that are laden with too much sugar!\r\nLastly, adding a handful of nuts and seeds on your papaya bowl will\r\nadd a generous serving of protein, healthy fats, fibre, and beneficial\r\nmicronutrients. Nuts and seeds also help to keep us fuller for longer -\r\nmeaning that they can help with weight\r\nregulation and protect against various chronic diseases.\r\nIngredients for one serving:\r\nHalf a papaya\r\n3/4 cup of natural yogurt\r\nHandful of nuts (e.g. walnuts, almonds, macadamias) and seeds\r\n(e.g. chia, flax seeds, or pumpkin seeds) - experiment with this and\r\ndiversify! The more variety, the better! :)\r\nSteps:\r\nCut the papaya in half (length wise) and scoop out the seeds if you\r\nwish (technically, the seeds are edible and have even been linked to\r\nsome health\r\nbenefits - but they are bitter)\r\nSpoon the yogurt into the papaya and sprinkle with your selection of\r\nnuts and seeds\r\nOptional - add a drizzle of honey or your choice of sweetener if you\r\nhave a bit of a sweet tooth (like me)\r\nDig in!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Sodas.Sweet breads…what do\r\nall these foods have in common?\r\nThe first thing that probably comes to mind is the fact that these\r\nare foods which should be eaten in moderation, in line with the\r\nprinciples set out by the Australian\r\ndietary guidelines. This is because discretionary foods are\r\ntypically high in sugar, saturated and trans fats, salt, and/or alcohol\r\n- often displacing more nutritious foods and resulting in a\r\nnutritionally deficient diet1. However, beyond this, they are\r\nalso classified as Ultra-Processed Foods (UPFs) which are defined by the\r\nNOVA food classification system as:\r\n“Ready-to-consume\r\nindustrial formulations of homogenised cheap ingredients obtained from\r\nhigh-yield crops, notably sugars and syrups, refined starches, oils and\r\nfats, protein isolates, and also sometimes from remnants of intensively\r\nreared animals. Such formulations are made to look, smell, and taste\r\ngood or often irresistible, by use of sophisticated combinations of\r\nflavours, colours, emulsifiers, sweeteners, thickeners and other\r\nadditives that have a cosmetic function”1\r\nThe consumption of UPFs has skyrocketed in the last several decades\r\nand has coincided with a trend towards diets that are associated with\r\nhigher rates of obesity and non-communicable diseases all around the\r\nworld.2 What’s\r\nmore, rather than simply displacing healthy food intake, UPFs seem to\r\nhave a direct effect on health-related outcomes3, including mental health\r\nrisk.4 Beyond the\r\nunhealthy properties of UPFs, what makes these foods particularly\r\ndetrimental is the fact that they contain little to no intact food, are\r\nvery energy-dense, typically have high glycemic loads, and can be\r\nformulated to be quasi-addictive.1\r\nSo how can you spot an ultra-processed food? Firstly, fresh\r\nvegetables, fruit, starchy roots and tubers, pasteurised milk and\r\nchilled meat (as well as various plant oils, sugar, and salt) are not\r\nultra-processed.1\r\nSecondly, an easy way to identify if something is ultra-processed is by\r\nhow it is packaged and if the ingredients list contains at least one\r\nitem that would not ordinarily be used in a kitchen or classes of\r\nadditives which include flavours, flavour enhancers, colours,\r\nemulsifiers, sweeteners, and thickeners. To find out more about\r\nadditives, see these further resources for the US\r\nand Australia.\r\nImage credit: Fikri Rasyid on Unsplash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of my all time favourite meals that I absolutely devour\r\nevery time. A very simple, quick, and nutritious lunch or dinner that\r\ncontains a serving of salmon, buckwheat soba noodles, and plenty of\r\ngreens!\r\nSalmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and various essential\r\nminerals and vitamins that are health-promoting. The omega-3 fats, which\r\nare an essential fat that must be derived from our diet, have not only\r\nbeen linked to better inflammatory and cardio-metabolic outcomes, but\r\nare also increasingly linked to clinical benefits in depression.1,2 And a top\r\ntip - if you can leave the salmon skin on, then you’ll be getting the highest\r\nconcentration of omega-3s!\r\nThis recipe also includes a variety of veggies - such as broccoli,\r\ncauliflower, and asparagus (but these can be substituted for any other\r\nveg that you prefer) - which are not only high in dietary fibre and\r\nmicronutrients, but may also protect against depression.3,4 You can opt\r\nfor fresh produce or frozen vegetables - they are both equally\r\nas nutritious, and frozen veggies are sometimes even more\r\nnutrient-dense because they are picked at their peak ripeness. It can\r\nalso help with reducing food wastage and is generally friendlier on the\r\nwallet. Win-win!\r\nIngredients for two servings:\r\n2 salmon fillets (skin on)\r\n180 g buckwheat soba noodles\r\n2 cups veggies of choice: broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, etc.\r\n(fresh or frozen)\r\nHomemade Teriyaki sauce (following this recipe)\r\nCorn flour\r\nOlive oil\r\nSesame seeds to garnish (optional)\r\nSteps:\r\nPrepare the teriyaki sauce as outlined above (or, if you prefer, you\r\ncan of course purchase a ready-made bottled version - but I would\r\nrecommend looking at the amount of sodium/sugar in some of these, they\r\ncan sometimes be exceedingly high!)\r\nPrepare a pot of water and gently bring up to the boil\r\nMeanwhile, dust the salmon fillets with a light layer of corn flour\r\non all sides\r\nPre-heat a shallow frying pan with a few table spoons of oil over a\r\nmedium heat, and pan fry salmon fillets on each side for 2-3 minutes\r\ndepending on how well done you like your salmon. Set aside once cooked\r\nto your liking.\r\nPrepare your veggies - if using fresh produce, I like to cut the\r\nveggies into bite-size pieces and either steam or gently fry on a low\r\nheat. If frozen, I either defrost the veggies in the microwave or heat\r\nthem up on the pan in some of the teriyaki sauce (read on for this\r\nstep).\r\nWhile the veggies are being cooked, prepare the soda noodles in the\r\nlarge pot of boiling water (no need to add extra salt to the water, as\r\nthe soda noodles are already salted) as per packet instructions. Drain\r\nand rinse in some cold water once cooked so that the noodles don’t stick\r\ntogether. Set aside.\r\nHeat up about 3/4 cup of the terikyaki sauce in a shallow pan and\r\nplace the salmon fillets in the sauce so that they are evenly coated.\r\nDuring this step, I also like to add the frozen vegetables so that they\r\nheat up at the same time and are coated in the teriyaki sauce.\r\nOnce the veggies are done, plate everything up - one piece of\r\nsalmon, a serving of soba noodles and veggies, and a light drizzle of\r\nthe teriyaki sauce over the noodles.\r\nSprinkle with some sesame seeds and enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

And on and on the list goes…\r\nExamples of popular (and controversial) fad diets in the past:\r\nRaw Foods Diet\r\nAlkaline Diet\r\nCabbage Soup Diet\r\nSubway Diet\r\nWhile fad diets often gain lots of popularity and traction with the\r\ngeneral public because they offer a quick and easy fix to various health\r\nconcerns, they are generally not based on any solid empirical evidence.\r\nAnd what’s more, these types of diets could even be potentially harmful\r\nbecause they often cut out whole food groups or restrict caloric intake\r\nand other important nutrients (e.g. juice diet). If you need a reminder\r\nof what a well-balanced daily intake of the core food groups looks like,\r\nthen check out this food\r\nselection guide provided by the Australian dietary guidelines.\r\nSo how can you stay informed and look out for fad diet promises? For\r\none, fad diets or any kind of ‘miracle’ supplements or products are\r\noften endorsed by celebrities, influencers, and other organisations that\r\nhave no qualification in dietetics or nutrition.

But what exactly does healthy\r\neating look like?

    "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan what we eat really improve our mood?\r\nThis is the question that a relatively new field of research is\r\ntrying to investigate. Nutritional psychiatry tries to understand how\r\noverall dietary patterns - as well as specific foods or food groups -\r\ninfluence our overall mental and brain health1. And while most of the existing\r\nevidence so far is observational - meaning, we cannot draw any causal\r\ninferences from their results - there is a consistent trend for healthy\r\ndiets protecting against the risk of depressive symptoms over time2.\r\nUnhealthy diets, on the other hand, may increase our risk for\r\ndepression, although the evidence for this is still rather mixed3.\r\nThere are also a growing number of randomised controlled trials,\r\nwhich is the strongest form of evidence for cause and effect, showing\r\nthat adhering to healthy diets can improve symptoms of depression in the\r\ngeneral population4 as well\r\nas in individuals with more severe forms of depression5. However, we still have a long\r\nway to go before we can definitively prescribe particular diets to\r\npeople with diagnosed depression. For instance, we are currently still\r\nin the process of understanding how exactly diet may confer\r\neffects on our mental health, which will be the topic of a separate blog\r\npost. Associations with anxiety are also much less researched, even\r\nthough anxiety and depression often co-occur at very high rates!\r\nUnderstanding what exactly is meant by a healthy diet is also an\r\nimportant factor to consider, as we are often bombarded by lots of\r\ninformation in mainstream media about the latest diet fads, juice\r\ncleanses, and detox diets. Which sources are evidence-based and which\r\nare just social media hype?
