Welcome to my blog.\r\n              My name is Djamila and I’m currently in the final year\r\n              of my PhD. I am investigating how diet is associated with\r\n              mental and gastrointestinal health, and the gut microbiota\r\n              - the ecosystem of microorganisms residing within our\r\n              guts\r\n              The study that I’ve been working on for the last\r\n              several years is called Bugs\r\n              and Brains: The Gut and Mental Health Study. It is the\r\n              world’s first study to compare the physiological and\r\n              microbial profiles of healthy adults to those with\r\n              irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), anxiety and depression,\r\n              and those with comorbid IBS and anxiety/depression\r\n              I am passionate about all things food and how we can\r\n              eat to feel well physically and mentally - how to feed\r\n              (feel) happy\r\n              Thank you for joining me on this journey! x\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Hi there!
