abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have shown the protective effects of Mediterranean Dietary Pattern (MDP) in psychological disorders. OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study was designed to determine the association between adherence to MDP and depression, anxiety and stress among female adolescents aged 16.20±0.97 in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Data from 263 participants were analyzed. Adherence to MDP was determined using Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern Score (MSDPS). Depression, anxiety and stress scores were characterized by DASS-21 (Depression Anxiety Stress Score-21 items) questionnaire. RESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress across quintiles of MSDPS. After adjustment for age, the odds ratio (OR) for depression in the highest quintile of MSDPS was 0.44 (95%confidence interval [95%CI], 0.19-0.95), (P for trend = 0.009) compared to the lowest quintile. After additional adjustment for BMI, energy intake, physical activity, ethnicity, parents education level and total family income, subjects in the highest quintile had a 59% lower prevalence of depression compared to those in the lowest quintile of MSDPS (OR = 0.41;95%CI, 0.17-0.97), (P for trend = 0.010). However, the MSDPS was not significantly associated with the presence of anxiety and stress. CONCLUSION: Adherence to MDP is associated with a reduced presence of depressive symptoms in female adolescents.},

abstract = {The nascent field of ‘Nutritional Psychiatry' offers much promise for addressing the large disease burden associated with mental disorders. A consistent evidence base from the observational literature confirms that the quality of individuals' diets is related to their risk for common mental disorders, such as depression. This is the case across countries and age groups. Moreover, new intervention studies implementing dietary changes suggest promise for the prevention and treatment of depression. Concurrently, data point to the utility of selected nutraceuticals as adjunctive treatments for mental disorders and as monotherapies for conditions such as ADHD. Finally, new studies focused on understanding the biological pathways that mediate the observed relationships between diet, nutrition and mental health are pointing to the immune system, oxidative biology, brain plasticity and the microbiome-gut-brain axis as key targets for nutritional interventions. On the other hand, the field is currently limited by a lack of data and methodological issues such as heterogeneity, residual confounding, measurement error, and challenges in measuring and ensuring dietary adherence in intervention studies. Key challenges for the field are to now: replicate, refine and scale up promising clinical and population level dietary strategies; identify a clear set of biological pathways and targets that mediate the identified associations; conduct scientifically rigorous nutraceutical and ‘psychobiotic' interventions that also examine predictors of treatment response; conduct observational and experimental studies in psychosis focused on dietary and related risk factors and treatments; and continue to advocate for policy change to improve the food environment at the population level.},

abstract = {Background: Depression imposes immense public health burden, demonstrating an urgent need of the identification of modifiable risk factors. Only a few cohort studies have analyzed the association between Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) and depression but with mixed results. We examined the impact of MDP on clinically ascertained depression in a large population-based dataset. Methods: In 1991/92, detailed information on diet, using a food frequency questionnaire, and potential confounding factors (body weight, height, educational attainment, smoking, previous diabetes and hypertension, and physical activity) was collected, in a random sample of 49,261 Swedish women aged 29-49. Adherence to MDP was calculated. Clinical depression was extracted from the National Patient Register. Study participants were followed up through 2012. Results: During an average follow-up of 20.4 years, 1677 incident cases of depression were diagnosed. We observed a lower risk of depression for medium (score 4-5) and high (6-9) adherence to MDP, compared with low (0-3) adherence (Medium: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.81-1.00; High: HR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.71-0.94). Per unit increase of adherence, the risk of depression was reduced by 5% (HR = 0.95, 95%CI = 0.92-0.98). The association became stronger when restricting to severe form of depression (HR = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.33-0.76). The HRs were higher from age 50 onward both over the first and the second 10-year follow-up period, compared with before age 50, indicating stronger association with increasing age. Results remained after extensive sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet at middle age was associated with a lower risk of depression later in life among Swedish women.},

abstract = {Objective: Depression, one of the most prevalent and disabling disorders in Europe, is thought to be associated with unhealthy eating styles. As prevalence of depression and eating styles potentially differ across Europe, the current study aimed to investigate in a large, European sample, the associations of history of major depressive disorder and depression severity with unhealthy eating styles. Methods: Baseline data of the MooDFOOD prevention study was used. The current analysis included 990 participants of four European countries (The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain). Analyses of Covariance and linear regression analyses were performed with depression history or depression severity as determinants, and emotional, uncontrolled, and cognitive restrained eating (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised, 18 item) as outcomes. Results: Depression history and severity were associated with more emotional and uncontrolled eating and with less cognitive restrained eating. Mood, somatic, and cognitive symptom clusters were also associated with more emotional and uncontrolled eating, and with less cognitive restrained eating. The somatic depressive symptoms “increased appetite” and “increased weight” were more strongly associated to unhealthy eating styles compared to other symptoms. No differences in associations between depression and unhealthy eating were found between European countries. Conclusion: Our results suggest that depression is related to more unhealthy eating styles. Diminishing unhealthy eating styles in subthreshold depressed persons could potentially reduce adverse health consequences like weight gain, unhealthy dietary patterns and weight-related diseases. It is also possible that interventions that decrease depressive symptoms can lead to a decrease in unhealthy eating styles.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consumption of a prudent dietary pattern rich in healthy nutrients is associated with enhanced cognitive performance in older adulthood, while a Western dietary pattern low in healthy nutrients is associated with poor age-related cognitive function. Sex differences exist in dietary intake among older adults; however, there is a paucity of research examining the relationship between sex-specific dietary patterns and cognitive function in later life. METHODS: The current study aimed to investigate sex differences in the relationship between sex-specific dietary pattern adherence and global cognitive function at baseline and over a 3-year follow-up in 1268 community-dwelling older adults (Mage = 74 years, n = 664 women, n = 612 men) from the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging (NuAge). A 78-item Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to estimate dietary intake over the previous year. Sex-specific dietary pattern scores were derived using principal component analysis. Global cognition was assessed using the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS). RESULTS: Adjusted linear mixed effects models indicated that a healthy, prudent dietary pattern was not associated with baseline cognitive performance in men or women. No relationship was found between Western dietary pattern adherence and baseline cognitive function in women. Among men, adherence to an unhealthy, Western dietary pattern was associated with poorer baseline cognitive function ($\beta$ = - 0.652, p = 0.02, 95% CI [- 1.22, - 0.65]). No association was found between prudent or Western dietary patterns and cognitive change over time in men or women. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of conducting sex-based analyses in aging research and suggest that the relationship between dietary pattern adherence and cognitive function in late life may be sex-dependent.},

abstract = {Blueberries are rich in polyphenols that may be beneficial to cognitive performance and mood. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of blueberries and blueberry products on measures of cognition and mood. In total, eleven articles (that included 12 studies) were identified using freeze-dried blueberries (n = 9 studies), whole blueberries (n = 2) and blueberry concentrate (n = 1). These studies were conducted in children (n = 5), young adults (n = 1), and older people with either no known cognitive impairment (n = 4) or indicated cognitive impairment (n = 2). Eight studies reported blueberry consumption or supplementation at various doses and time lengths to improve measures of cognitive performance, particularly short- and long-term memory and spatial memory. For mood, one study reported significant between-group improvements in positive affect from blueberry products, whereas four studies reported no improvement. Low risk of bias were observed across all studies. Based on the current evidence, blueberries may improve some measures of cognitive performance. However, considerable differences in study design, dosages, and anthocyanin content hinder between-study comparison. The use of standardized blueberry interventions, consideration of placebo formulations, and consistently reported cognitive performance tools are recommended in future trials.

abstract = {Research in the past decade has shown that variations in the gut microbiome may influence behavior, and vice versa. As such, interest in the role of the gut microbiome in psychiatric conditions has drawn immense interest. This is evidenced by the recent surge in published studies examining microbial dysbiosis in clinical psychiatric populations, particularly autism spectrum disorder and depression. However, critical examination of these studies reveals methodological flaws in design and execution, suggesting that they may not be held to the same standards as other bodies of clinical research. Given the complex nature of the gut microbiome, this narrative review attempts to clarify concepts critical to effectively examine its potential role in psychopathology to appropriately inform mental health researchers. More specifically, the numerous variables known to affect the gut microbiome are discussed, including inflammation, diet, weight, and medications. A comprehensive review of the extant microbiome literature in clinical psychiatric populations is also provided, in addition to clinical implications and suggestions for future directions of research. Although there is a clear need for additional studies to elucidate the gut microbiome's role in psychiatric disorders, there is an even greater need for well-designed, appropriately controlled studies to truly impact the field.},

Inflammation plays a key role in depression's pathogenesis for a subset of depressed individuals; depression also primes larger cytokine responses to stressors and pathogens that do not appear to habituate.

When combined with predisposing factors (moderators such as childhood adversity and obesity), stressors and pathogenscanleadtoexaggeratedorprolongedinflammatory responses. The resulting sickness behaviors (e.g., pain, disturbed sleep), depressive symptoms, and negative health behaviors (e.g., poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle) may act as mediating pathways that lead to further, unrestrained inflammation and depression. Depression, childhood adversity, stressors, and diet can all influence the gut microbiome and promoteintestinalpermeability, anotherpathway toenhanced inflammatory responses. Larger, more frequent, or more prolonged inflammatory responses could have negative mental and physical health consequences. In clinical practice, inflammation provides a guide to potential targets for symptom management by signaling responsiveness to certain therapeutic strategies. For example, a theme across research with cytokine antagonists,omega-3 fatty acids, celecoxib, and exercise is that anti-inflammatory interventions have a substantially greater impact on mood in individuals with heightened inflammation. Thus, when inflammation and depression co-occur, treating themin tandemmay enhance recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. The bidirectional links between depression, inflammation, and disease suggest that effective depression treatments could have a far-reaching impact on mood, inflammation, and health.},

abstract = {Background: Few studies have assessed adherence to the Mediterranean diet in relation to psychological health, in particular in the Middle East. Objective: To examine the association between adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern and prevalence of psychological disorders among a large population of Iranian adults. Design: In this cross-sectional study on 3172 Iranian adults aged 18–55 years, we used a validated food frequency questionnaire for the assessment of dietary intakes. Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern was examined using the Trichopoulou et al. method. To assess psychological health, the Iranian validated version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used. Psychological distress was assessed through the use of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Results: Mean age of study participants was 36.54 ± 4.97 years. After controlling for potential confounders, participants with the greatest adherence to the Mediterranean diet had lower odds for depression (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.46–0.78), anxiety (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42–0.86) and psychological distress (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.45–0.79) compared with those with the lowest adherence. When the association with components of Mediterranean diet was examined, we found that high intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower odds of depression, anxiety and psychological distress. In contrast, high intake of grains was positively associated with depression, anxiety and psychological distress. Conclusion: We found evidence indicating an inverse association between adherence to Mediterranean dietary pattern and odds of psychological disorders including depression, anxiety and psychological distress.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is a mood disorder characterized by a high rate of resistance to pharmacological treatments, which has often been linked to chronic inflammation. This can be influenced by different environmental factors, in particular pro-inflammatory diets. However, a mediating role of circulating inflammation has never been observed. Aim: To test the association between a dietary inflammatory index (DII{\textregistered}) and continuous depressive symptoms (adapted version of PHQ9) in an Italian population cohort (N=13,301), along with potential explanatory effect of a composite index (INFLA-score) based on four circulating inflammatory biomarkers: C-reactive protein, granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet and white blood cell counts. Results: Significant positive associations were observed between DII and total depressive symptoms (standardized $\beta$ (SE) = 0.038 (0.005), p < 0.001), and with two factors tagging somatic (0.012 (0.003), p < 0.001) and cognitive symptoms (0.012 (0.003), p < 0.001), after adjustment for different potential confounders (socioeconomic status, chronic health conditions and lifestyles). These associations were about twice as strong in women than in men. INFLA-score explained a small but significant proportion of the association with total depressive symptoms (0.90–2.30%, p < 0.05), which was mainly driven by granulocyte-tolymphocyte ratio (1.18–1.65%). This effect was even stronger for the somatic (2.66–4.66%) but not for the cognitive factor (0%). Conclusion: These findings support a strong link between inflammatory diet and depression, especially with somatic symptoms and within women. Moreover, they provide novel evidence for a potential explanatory role of circulating inflammation in this association, suggesting new paths for prevention and treatment of major and atypical depression.},

abstract = {Plant-based dietary patterns (vegan and vegetarian) are often considered ‘healthy' and have been associated with broad health benefits, including decreased risk of obesity and ill health (cardiovascular disease, blood glucose and type II diabetes). However, the association between plant-based diets and mood disorders such as depression remains largely equivocal. This cross-sectional study of 219 adults aged 18–44 (M=31.22, SD=7.40) explored the associations between an estimate of overall plant-based diet quality and depression in vegans (n=165) and vegetarians (n=54). Overall plant-based diet quality was associated with depressive symptoms in vegans and vegetarians F(1, 215)=13.71, p<0.001 accounting for 6% of the variation in depressive symptoms. For those without depression, higher diet quality was protective against depressive symptoms F(1, 125)=6.49, p=0.012. Conversely, for those with depression no association with diet quality was found F(1, 89)=0.01, p=0.963. These findings suggest that a high-quality plant-based diet may be protective against depressive symptoms in vegans and vegetarians. In line with emerging research between food and mental health, higher-quality dietary patterns are associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms. Given the rapidly increasing rate of vegan and vegetarian food products within Australia, understanding the potential mechanisms of effects through which a plant-based diet may influence depressive symptoms is required.},

A total of 24,306 participants (mean age, 41 years; range 18-91 years) were enrolled. DF intake was assessed using a validated self-administered food frequency questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Self-Rating Depression Scale. Associations between DF intake and depressive symptoms were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Socio-demographic, behavioral, health status, and dietary factors were adjusted. In men, compared to participants in the lowest quartiles for total, soluble, vegetable, and soy DF, odds ratios (ORs; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for depressive symptoms in the highest were 0.83 (0.69, 0.99), 0.74 (0.63, 0.87), 0.79 (0.65, 0.96), and 0.69 (0.60, 0.81), respectively. In women, compared to participants in the lowest quartiles for vegetable and soy DF, the ORs (95% CIs) for depressive symptoms in the highest were 0.77 (0.64, 0.93) and 0.82 (0.70, 0.95), respectively. No association was found between total or soluble DF intake and depressive symptoms in women. No association was found between insoluble, cereal, fruit, or tuber DF intake and depressive symptoms in men and women. Linear associations between DF intake and depressive symptoms were only detected for soy foods DF (men, $\beta$ =-0.148, P < 0.0001; women, $\beta$ =-0.069, P = 0.04). Results suggest intake of soluble, vegetable, and soy DF were inversely associated with depressive symptoms. These results should be confirmed through prospective and interventional studies.},

For this reason alternative therapies, including herbal medication such as saffron, have been proposed. We aimed to assess the effects of saffron extract for the treatment of anxiety and depression using a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial design. Methods: Sixty adult patients with anxiety and depression were randomized to receive a 50 mg saffron capsule (Crocus sativus L. stigma) or a placebo capsule twice daily for 12 weeks. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) questionnaires were used at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks after initiating medication. 54 subjects completed the trial. Results: Saffron supplements had a significant effect on the BDI and BAI scores of subjects in comparison to placebo at the 12 week time-point (p<0.001). Conclusions: Saffron appears to have a significant impact in the treatment of anxiety and depression disorder. Side effects were rare.},

Although nutrition has been related with affective disorders, there is a lack of studies assessing the relation between dietary habits and anxiety among European and Mediterranean older populations. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the association between dietary habits, energy intake, and anxiety symptoms using data from 1128 Greek older adults (>50 years) without pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or any other chronic disease who participated in the ATTICA study. Various socio demographic lifestyle, bio-clinical (e.g., blood pressure), and psychological (e.g., depression) characteristics were used, and dietary habits as well as energy intake were calculated using standard procedures. Older people with anxiety were more likely to be sedentary, to be smokers, and to show symptoms of depression. The saturated fat and added sugars (SFAS) dietary pattern was associated with higher anxiety levels (non-standardized b (95% CI): 5.82 (0.03 to 11.61)). No association between energy intake tertiles and anxiety levels pictured in the later regression model. Moreover, female gender, family status, and depression were positively related to anxiety. Therefore, promoting healthy dietary habits could reduce anxiety symptoms of the older adults.},

abstract = {The changing of omega-6/omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the food supply of Western societies occurred over the last 150 years is thought to promote the pathogenesis of many inflammatory-related diseases, including depressive disorders. Several epidemiological studies reported a significant inverse correlation between intake of oily fish and depression or bipolar disorders. Studies conducted specifically on the association between omega-3 intake and depression reported contrasting results, suggesting that the preventive role of omega-3 PUFA may depend also on other factors, such as overall diet quality and the social environment. Accordingly, tertiary prevention with omega-3 PUFA supplement in depressed patients has reached greater effectiveness during the last recent years, although definitive statements on their use in depression therapy cannot be yet freely asserted. Among the biological properties of omega-3 PUFA, their anti-inflammatory effects and their important role on the structural changing of the brain should be taken into account to better understand the possible pathway through which they can be effective both in preventing or treating depression. However, the problem of how to correct the inadequate supply of omega-3 PUFA in the Westernized countries' diet is a priority in order to set food and health policies and also dietary recommendations for individuals and population groups. {\textcopyright} 2014 Giuseppe Grosso et al.},

abstract = {Studies have examined the association between depressive symptoms and dietary patterns; however, only few studies focused on older adults. The present study examines the association between current and past dietary patterns and depression in a community-dwelling adult population aged 55 years and over. Adults (n 4082) were recruited into the Wellbeing, Eating and Exercise for a Long Life study in Victoria, Australia. In 2010 and 2014, data were collected using self-administered questionnaires including a 111-item FFQ, the RAND thirty-six-item Short Form Health Survey of health-related quality of life and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale in 2014. Current (2014) and past (2010) dietary patterns were determined using principal component analysis. Association between dietary patterns and depressive symptoms was assessed using a mixed model analysis with adjustment for covariates. Two similar dietary patterns were identified in men and women (n 2142). In women, a healthy dietary pattern (characterised by frequent intake of vegetables, fruits and fish) was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms (current diet: $\beta$ = -0{\textperiodcentered}260, 95 % CI -0{\textperiodcentered}451, -0{\textperiodcentered}070; past diet: $\beta$ = -0{\textperiodcentered}201, 95 % CI -0{\textperiodcentered}390, -0{\textperiodcentered}013). A current unhealthy dietary pattern in women (characterised by frequent intake of red and processed meat, potatoes, hot chips, cakes, deserts and ice cream) was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms ($\beta$ = 1{\textperiodcentered}367, 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}679, 2{\textperiodcentered}056). No associations were identified in men. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the differences that may occur by sex.},

abstract = {Background: Despite omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) supplementation in depressed patients have been suggested to improve depressive symptomatology, previous findings are not univocal. Objectives: To conduct an updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of omega-3 PUFA treatment of depressive disorders, taking into account the clinical differences among patients included in the studies. Methods: A search on MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database of RCTs using omega-3 PUFA on patients with depressive symptoms published up to August 2013 was performed. Standardized mean difference in clinical measure of depression severity was primary outcome. Type of omega-3 used (particularly eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and omega-3 as mono- or adjuvant therapy was also examined. Meta-regression analyses assessed the effects of study size, baseline depression severity, trial duration, dose of omega-3, and age of patients. Results: Meta-analysis of 11 and 8 trials conducted respectively on patients with a DSM-defined diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and patients with depressive symptomatology but no diagnosis of MDD demonstrated significant clinical benefit of omega-3 PUFA treatment compared to placebo (standardized difference in random-effects model 0.56 SD [95% CI: 0.20, 0.92] and 0.22 SD [95% CI: 0.01, 0.43], respectively; pooled analysis was 0.38 SD [95% CI: 0.18, 0.59]). Use of mainly EPA within the preparation, rather than DHA, influenced final clinical efficacy. Significant clinical efficacy had the use of omega-3 PUFA as adjuvant rather than mono-therapy. No relation between efficacy and study size, baseline depression severity, trial duration, age of patients, and study quality was found. Omega-3 PUFA resulted effective in RCTs on patients with bipolar disorder, whereas no evidence was found for those exploring their efficacy on depressive symptoms in young populations, perinatal depression, primary disease other than depression and healthy subjects. Conclusions: The use of omega-3 PUFA is effective in patients with diagnosis of MDD and on depressive patients without diagnosis of MDD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Grosso et al.},

abstract = {Background: Mental health has become a major public health issue worldwide. Biological and epidemiological studies suggest diet has a role in the prevention or cure of mental disorders. However, further research is required to elucidate the relationship between diet and mental health. This study aimed to investigate associations between dietary intake of nutrients (macronutrients, vitamins, calcium, and fatty acids) and food groups (fish, meat and chicken, dairy products, and vegetables) and mental health among middle-aged Japanese in cross-sectional and prospective studies. Methods: In total, 9298 men and women that participated in two areas of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study were eligible for analysis at the baseline (cross-sectional) survey. Of these, 4701 participants were followed for about 5 years and included in the follow-up (prospective) analysis. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to assess participants' general mental health status over the past several weeks. The average intake of 46 foods over the past year was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire. We also evaluated lifestyle and medical factors using a self-administered questionnaire. A cross-sectional logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate odds ratios for a GHQ score ≥ 4 (poor mental health) according to dietary intake of foods/nutrients at baseline. The prospective study used baseline dietary and lifestyle factors and GHQ scores at follow-up. Results: The cross-sectional logistic regression analysis showed vegetables, protein, calcium, vitamin D, carotene and n-3 highly-polyunsaturated fatty acids were inversely associated with a GHQ score ≥ 4. On the other hand, mono-unsaturated fatty acids showed a positive association with higher GHQ score. The prospective logistic regression analysis found dairy products, calcium, vitamin B2, and saturated fatty acids were inversely correlated with a GHQ score ≥ 4. Calcium was associated with GHQ scores in both the cross-sectional and follow-up studies. In the follow-up study, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for a GHQ score ≥ 4 was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.92) for the highest versus lowest quartiles of calorie-adjusted dietary calcium intake. Conclusion: Consuming particular nutrients and foods, especially calcium and dairy products, may lead to better mental health in Japanese adults.},

abstract = {Stress increases inflammation but whether adherence to Mediterranean diet counteracts this association and how early can these effects be observed is not well known. We tested whether (1) cortisol is associated to inflammation, (2) cortisol is associated to the adolescent Mediterranean diet score (aMDS), (3) aMDS lessens inflammation, (4) aMDS associates with cortisol levels and inflammation. Two hundred and forty-two adolescents (137 females; 12.5–17.5 years old) provided salivary cortisol, blood and 2-day 24-h dietary recall from which aMDS was derived. Cortisol levels were associated with increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF-$\alpha$ B = 11.887, p = 0.001) when adjusted for age, gender, parental education and body mass index (BMI). Moreover, cortisol levels were inversely associated to adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (B = −1.023, p = 0.002). Adolescents with higher adherence to aMDS had lower levels of interleukins (IL) IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$, compared to those who did not adhere. The association between cortisol and TNF-$\alpha$ was no longer significant when aMDS was included in the model (B = 6.118, p = 0.139). In addition, comparing lower and higher aMDS groups, the association between cortisol and TNF-$\alpha$ was only observed in those with lower aMDS adherence. Our study suggests that adherence to the Mediterranean Diet may counteract the effect of stress on inflammatory biomarkers which may contribute to decreasing the risk of future mental health.},

abstract = {Context: More than 300 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with depression, which is a leading cause of disability and disease burden. Elucidating dietary patterns that may reduce the risk of depression could help reduce the incidence of other diseases. Data Sources: PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify relevant publications up to May 2018. Study Selection: All observational studies that considered the Mediterranean diet as the exposure variable and depression as the main outcome or as one of the outcome variables were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Two authors independently screened 3229 publications. A total of 14 observational studies were included in the metaanalysis. Data Extraction: Two authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Results: The studies in the meta-analysis included a total of 56 043 participants. When 5 effect sizes from 4 cohort studies were combined, no significant association was observed between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of depression (overall hazard ratio 1/40.95; 95%CI, 0.79-1.16). When 3 effect sizes from 3 cohort studies that reported b coefficients were combined, again no significant association was found (b1/40.00; 95%CI, 0.12, 0.12). However, when 9 effect sizes from 9 cross-sectional studies were combined, an inverse significant association was found between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of depression (overall odds ratio 1/40.72; 95%CI, 0.60-0.87). Conclusions: The analysis of cohort studies revealed no significant association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of depression. However, an inverse significant association was found between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and odds of depression in cross-sectional studies.},

abstract = {Background: Inflammatory markers are raised in cross-sectional studies of depressed patients and may represent an important mediating factor for behaviour, neural plasticity and brain structure. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of longitudinal studies, investigating whether raised inflammatory markers indicate an increased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms. We searched three databases (1970-2012) for longitudinal studies with repeat data on CRP or IL-6 levels and subsequent depressive symptoms. We calculated effect sizes using a mixed-effects model, with separate meta-analyses for inflammatory markers and age groups. Results: We identified eight papers for CRP (14,832 participants) and three for IL-6 (3695 participants). There was a significant association between increased CRP and depressive symptoms (weighted-mean effect size 'unadjusted r = 0.069, p < 0.0005; 'adjusted r=0.046, p < 0.0005), with moderate heterogeneity between studies (Q =11.21, p = 0.08,12=46.5). For IL-6 the weighted-mean effect size was smaller ('unadjusted r=0.045, p-value=0.007; 'adjusted r=0.097, p-value = 0.06). Limitations: The meta-analysis was based on a relatively small number of studies (particularly for IL-6) and only two inflammatory markers. There was moderate heterogeneity between studies and some evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: Raised inflammatory markers have a small but significant association with the subsequent development of depressive symptoms. This is a robust effect which remains significant after adjustment for age and a wide range of factors associated with risk for depression. Our results support the hypothesis that there is a causal pathway from inflammation to depression. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Jacka2013,
abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we aimed to examine the relationship between diet quality and depression in a prospective study of adolescents from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Design: In this prospective cohort study, data were collected at two time points (2001 and 2003) from nearly 3,000 adolescents, aged either 11-12 years or 13-14 years, participating in RELACHS, a study of ethnically diverse and socially deprived young people from East London in the UK. Diet quality was measured from dietary questionnaires, and mental health assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ). Results: In cross-sectional analyses, we found evidence for an association between an unhealthy diet and mental health problems. Compared to those in the lowest quintile of Unhealthy diet score, those in the highest quintile were more than twice as likely to be symptomatic on the SDQ (OR 2.10, 95 %CI 1.38-3.20) after taking all identified confounders into account. There was also some evidence for a cross-sectional inverse association between a measure of healthy diet and mental health problems. A prospective relationship between the highest quintiles of both Healthy (OR 0.63, 95 %CI 0.38-1.05) and Unhealthy (OR 1.75, 95 %CI 1.00-3.06) diet scores and SDQ scores at follow-up was also evident, but was attenuated by final adjustments for confounders. Conclusion: This study is concordant with previous observational studies in describing relationships between measures of diet quality and mental health problems in adolescents. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Inflammatory diets are increasingly recognized as a modifiable determinant of mental illness. However, there is a dearth of studies in early life and across the full mental wellbeing spectrum (mental illness to positive wellbeing) at the population level. This is a critical gap given that inflammatory diet patterns and mental wellbeing trajectories typically establish by adolescence. We examined associations of inflammatory diet scores with mental wellbeing in 11-12 year-olds and mid-life adults. Throughout Australia, 1759 11-12 year-olds (49% girls) and 1812 parents (88% mothers) contributed cross-sectional population-based data. Alternate inflammatory diet scores were calculated from a 26-item food frequency questionnaire, based on prior literature and prediction of inflammatory markers respectively. Participants reported negatively- and positively-framed mental wellbeing via psychosocial health, quality of life and life satisfaction surveys. We used causal inference modelling techniques via generalized linear regression models (mean differences and risk ratios (RR)) to examine how inflammatory diets might influence mental wellbeing. In children and adults respectively, a one standard deviation (SD) higher literature-derived inflammatory diet score conferred between a 44% (RR 95%CI:1.2-1.8) to 57% (RR 95%CI:1.3-2.0) and 54% (95%CI: 1.2-2.0) to 86% (RR 95%CI:1.4-2.4) higher risk of being in the worst mental wellbeing category (i.e. <16th percentile) across outcome measures. Results for inflammation-derived scores were similar. Body mass index (BMI) mediated effects (21-39%) in adults. Inflammatory diet patterns were cross-sectionally associated with mental wellbeing at age 11-12 years, with similar effects observed in mid-adulthood. Reducing inflammatory dietary components in childhood could improve population-level mental wellbeing across the lifecourse.},

abstract = {Objective: Poor diet can be detrimental to mental health. However, the overall evidence for the effects of dietary interventions on mood and mental well-being has yet to be assessed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining effects of dietary interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety. Methods: Major electronic databases were searched through March 2018 for all randomized controlled trials of dietary interventions reporting changes in symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in clinical and nonclinical populations. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to determine effect sizes (Hedges' g with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) for dietary interventions compared with control conditions. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using subgroups and meta-regression analyses. Results: Sixteen eligible randomized controlled trials (published in English) with outcome data for 45,826 participants were included; the majority of which examined samples with nonclinical depression (n = 15 studies). Nonetheless, dietary interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms (g = 0.275, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.45, p =.002). Similar effects were observed among high-quality trials (g = 0.321, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.53, p =.002) and when compared with both inactive (g = 0.308, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.60, p =.038) and active controls (g = 0.174, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.34, p =.035). No effect of dietary interventions was observed for anxiety (k = 11, n = 2270, g = 0.100, 95% CI = -0.04 to 0.24, p =.148). Studies with female samples observed significantly greater benefits from dietary interventions, for symptoms of both depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Dietary interventions hold promise as a novel intervention for reducing symptoms of depression across the population. Future research is required to determine the specific components of dietary interventions that improve mental health, explore underlying mechanisms, and establish effective schemes for delivering these interventions in clinical and public health settings.

abstract = {Does it matter what we eat for our mental health? Accumulating data suggests that this may indeed be the case and that diet and nutrition are not only critical for human physiology and body composition, but also have significant effects on mood and mental wellbeing. While the determining factors of mental health are complex, increasing evidence indicates a strong association between a poor diet and the exacerbation of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions. There are common beliefs about the health effects of certain foods that are not supported by solid evidence and the scientific evidence demonstrating the unequivocal link between nutrition and mental health is only beginning to emerge. Current epidemiological data on nutrition and mental health do not provide information about causality or underlying mechanisms. Future studies should focus on elucidating mechanism. Randomized controlled trials should be of high quality, adequately powered and geared towards the advancement of knowledge from population-based observations towards personalized nutrition. Here, we provide an overview of the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, exploring the scientific evidence exemplifying the importance of a well-balanced diet for mental health. We conclude that an experimental medicine approach and a mechanistic understanding is required to provide solid evidence on which future policies on diet and nutrition for mental health can be based.},

abstract = {Background: Psychonutrition, i.e. the impact of diet on mental health, is an emerging field of psychiatry. Objective: The purpose of the present letter was to highlight recent findings in the field to guide nutritional interventions in psychiatry. Method: An overview of the most recent meta-analyses in the field of psychonutrition in severe mental disorders has been carried out. Results: The Mediterranean diet showed the best evidence for effectiveness in diminishing the incidence of depressive symptomatology Complementary agents were found to be associated with lower depression levels (even in psychiatric populations): omegas 3 fatty acids, vitamin D, methylfolate and S-adenosylmethionine, all being found in high rates in the Mediterranean diet. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) has also been found to be associated with lower depression. Moreover, major depression has been associated with inflammatory disturbances and a diet with a low Dietary Inflammatory Index has also been shown to be associated with lower depression. These effects may be mediated by microbiota modifications and probiotic supplementation has been recently shown to be effective in the treatment of depression. A high protein diet may also be particularly useful in psychiatry. The high protein diet has shown effectiveness in weight loss and increasing satiety with no evidence for deleterious effects in subjects without chronic conditions like renal failure, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. A reduction of 20% of calorific intake +/- intermittent fasting (i.e. fasting for 12 to 16 h per day) may also improve microbiota and therefore psychiatric conditions. Conclusion: In light of these findings, diet modifications appear to be an underutilized tool with which to improve the mental and physical health of psychiatric patients.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is a mood disorder characterized by a high rate of resistance to pharmacological treatments, which has often been linked to chronic inflammation. This can be influenced by different environmental factors, in particular pro-inflammatory diets. However, a mediating role of circulating inflammation has never been observed. Aim: To test the association between a dietary inflammatory index (DII{\textregistered}) and continuous depressive symptoms (adapted version of PHQ9) in an Italian population cohort (N=13,301), along with potential explanatory effect of a composite index (INFLA-score) based on four circulating inflammatory biomarkers: C-reactive protein, granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet and white blood cell counts. Results: Significant positive associations were observed between DII and total depressive symptoms (standardized $\beta$ (SE) = 0.038 (0.005), p < 0.001), and with two factors tagging somatic (0.012 (0.003), p < 0.001) and cognitive symptoms (0.012 (0.003), p < 0.001), after adjustment for different potential confounders (socioeconomic status, chronic health conditions and lifestyles). These associations were about twice as strong in women than in men. INFLA-score explained a small but significant proportion of the association with total depressive symptoms (0.90–2.30%, p < 0.05), which was mainly driven by granulocyte-tolymphocyte ratio (1.18–1.65%). This effect was even stronger for the somatic (2.66–4.66%) but not for the cognitive factor (0%). Conclusion: These findings support a strong link between inflammatory diet and depression, especially with somatic symptoms and within women. Moreover, they provide novel evidence for a potential explanatory role of circulating inflammation in this association, suggesting new paths for prevention and treatment of major and atypical depression.},

abstract = {Background: The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is associated with considerable health benefits for cardiovascular and cognitive health, particularly within the Mediterranean basin. Whether Australian populations will similarly benefit from the MedDiet is unknown. We aim to assess the effects of a MedDiet on cognitive and cardiovascular health indicators amongst the elderly (MedLey study). Here we describe in detail the protocol for the MedLey study. Methods: Medley is a randomised, parallel controlled dietary intervention trial. Data collection occurred at the Sansom Institute for Health Research, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia between 2013 and 2015. Omnivorous men and women aged ≥65 years, who were non-smokers, had no previously diagnosed cardiovascular disease, history of brain trauma, cognitive impairment, major disease or cancer were recruited from the general public (n = 166). The intervention comprised an Australianised version of the traditional MedDiet characterised by small amounts of red meat, processed deli meats and high sugar foods; moderate amounts of dairy and poultry; and a high plant food content including abundant extra virgin olive oil. Volunteers were stratified by age, gender and body mass index (kg/m2) to follow either their habitual diet (control condition) or the intervention MedDiet for 24 weeks. Primary outcome measures included cognitive function, endothelial function, cerebrovascular flow, blood lipids, inflammatory markers, fasting glucose and insulin, blood pressure, and body composition. Secondary outcomes included food cravings, psychological wellbeing and DNA damage markers. These were assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Dietary intakes were assessed at baseline, two and four months to assess adherence to the prescribed diet. For main outcome measures, groups will be compared over time using a linear mixed effects model, with Cohen's d effect sizes. Subgroup analysis based on adherence to the intervention, medications and alcohol consumption may be performed in an exploratory fashion. Discussion: The MedLey study will provide evidence as to whether dietary changes in line with an Australianised MedDiet can benefit cognitive performance, endothelial function and other cardiovascular risk factors and psychological wellbeing amongst older Australians. Results could inform formation of national dietary guidelines and nutrition-related practices such as dietetics. Trial registration: The trial was registered on the Australia New Zealand. Clinical Trials Register (ACTRN12613000602729). Trial registration date: 27 May 2013.},

abstract = {Purpose/introduction: There is no study on the association of empirically derived food-based dietary inflammatory index (FDII) and risk of psychological disorders. We investigated the association between FDII and odds of psychological disorders in Iranian adults. Methods and materials: In this cross-sectional study, data on dietary intakes of 3363 Iranian adult participants were collected using a validated dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. FDII score was constructed based on participants' dietary intakes of 28 pre-defined food groups. The Iranian validated version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to assess psychological disorders. Depression, anxiety and psychological distress were defined based on standard criteria. Results: After controlling for potential confounders, participants in the top quintile of FDII score had a greater odds of depression (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.08–2.06), anxiety (OR: 1.92; 95% CI: 1.24–2.96), and psychological distress (OR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.10–2.19) compared with those in the bottom quintile. When we did the analyses stratified by gender, we found a significant positive association between FDII score and depression (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.04–2.35), anxiety (OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.19–3.34), and psychological distress (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.10–2.56) among women comparing the highest and the lowest quintiles. We found no significant association between FDII score and psychological disorders in men. Conclusion: We found that greater FDII score was positively associated with psychological disorders. In the gender-stratified analysis, this was seen in women but not in men.},

abstract = {Context: Adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) is thought to reduce inflammatory, vascular, and metabolic processes that may be involved in the risk of clinical depression. Objective: To assess the association between adherence to the MDP and the incidence of clinical depression. Design: Prospective study that uses a validated 136-item food frequency questionnaire to assess adherence to the MDP. The MDP score positively weighted the consumption of vegetables, fruit and nuts, cereal, legumes, and fish; the monounsaturated- to saturated-fatty-acids ratio; and moderate alcohol consumption, whereas meat or meat products and whole-fat dairy were negatively weighted. Setting: A dynamic cohort of university graduates (Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra/University of Navarra Follow-up [SUN] Project). Participants: A total of 10 094 initially healthy Spanish participants from the SUN Project participated in the study. Recruitment began on December 21, 1999, and is ongoing. Main Outcome Measure: Participants were classified as having incident depression if they were free of depression and antidepressant medication at baseline and reported a physician-made diagnosis of clinical depression and/or antidepressant medication use during follow-up. Results: After a median follow-up of 4.4 years, 480 new cases of depression were identified. The multiple adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of depression for the 4 upper successive categories of adherence to the MDP (taking the category of lowest adherence as reference) were 0.74 (0.57-0.98), 0.66 (0.50-0.86), 0.49 (0.36-0.67), and 0.58 (0.44-0.77) (P for trend <.001). Inverse dose-response relationships were found for fruit and nuts, the monounsaturated- to saturated-fatty-acids ratio, and legumes. Conclusions: Our results suggest a potential protective role of the MDP with regard to the prevention of depressive disorders; additional longitudinal studies and trials are needed to confirm these findings. {\textcopyright}2009 American Medical Association.

abstract = {BackgroundReview findings on the role of dietary patterns in preventing depression are inconsistent, possibly due to variation in assessment of dietary exposure and depression. We studied the association between dietary patterns and depressive symptoms in six population-based cohorts and meta-analysed the findings using a standardised approach that defined dietary exposure, depression assessment and covariates.MethodsIncluded were cross-sectional data from 23 026 participants in six cohorts: InCHIANTI (Italy), LASA, NESDA, HELIUS (the Netherlands), ALSWH (Australia) and Whitehall II (UK). Analysis of incidence was based on three cohorts with repeated measures of depressive symptoms at 5-6 years of follow-up in 10 721 participants: Whitehall II, InCHIANTI, ALSWH. Three a priori dietary patterns, Mediterranean diet score (MDS), Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet were investigated in relation to depressive symptoms. Analyses at the cohort-level adjusted for a fixed set of confounders, meta-analysis used a random-effects model.ResultsCross-sectional and prospective analyses showed statistically significant inverse associations of the three dietary patterns with depressive symptoms (continuous and dichotomous). In cross-sectional analysis, the association of diet with depressive symptoms using a cut-off yielded an adjusted OR of 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.84-0.91) for MDS, 0.93 (0.88-0.98) for AHEI-2010, and 0.94 (0.87-1.01) for DASH. Similar associations were observed prospectively: 0.88 (0.80-0.96) for MDS; 0.95 (0.84-1.06) for AHEI-2010; 0.90 (0.84-0.97) for DASH.ConclusionPopulation-scale observational evidence indicates that adults following a healthy dietary pattern have fewer depressive symptoms and lower risk of developing depressive symptoms.},

abstract = {Research on major depression has confirmed that it is caused by an array of biopsychosocial and lifestyle factors. Diet, exercise and sleep are three such influences that play a significant mediating role in the development, progression and treatment of this condition. This review summarises animal- and human-based studies on the relationship between these three lifestyle factors and major depressive disorder, and their influence on dysregulated pathways associated with depression: namely neurotransmitter processes, immuno-inflammatory pathways, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbances, oxidative stress and antioxidant defence systems, neuroprogression, and mitochondrial disturbances. Increased attention in future clinical studies on the influence of diet, sleep and exercise on major depressive disorder and investigations of their effect on physiological processes will help to expand our understanding and treatment of major depressive disorder. Mental health interventions, taking into account the bidirectional relationship between these lifestyle factors and major depression are also likely to enhance the efficacy of interventions associated with this disorder. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Using the PubMed database, 34 publications (23 cross-sectional, 10 prospective cohort, and 1 case-control studies) were identified. The number of subjects (n=80-27,111), age of subjects (15-97 years), dietary assessment method (dietary record, diet history interview, and validated and non-validated dietary questionnaire), depressive symptom assessment (discharge diagnosis, established scale, and self-reported information) varied among studies. Dietary variables most frequently investigated included long chain n-3 PUFA, fish, folate, and other B vitamins. Most studies found no association between dietary variables and depressive symptoms. However, most studies included at least one important methodological limitation, such as no inference for causality, unreliable or rough assessment of diet or depressive symptoms, inadequate treatment of potential confounding factors, and ignorance of the possible mediating or confounding influence of other dietary variables. Further evidence from well-designed observational studies is required to confirm or refute the association between dietary intake and depressive symptoms in free-living settings.},

Setting: Population based. Subjects: A total of 1651 subjects (560 men and 1091 women) including everybody aged 70 y or more, and a random sample of people (about 40%) aged 65-69 y resident in four rural towns in the province of Pavia, Italy in 1992-1993. Interventions: The healthy diet indicator based on the WHO guidelines for the prevention of chronic diseases was calculated as reported by Huijbregts et al (1998; Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 52,826-831). Food intake was estimated by means of a 180-item food-frequency questionnaire and nutrient intake was calculated using the food composition database compiled for epidemiologic studies in Italy. The cognitive function was categorized into four levels-normal cognition, mild, moderate and severe cognitive deficit-according to the neuropsychological test score. The relationship beween the dietary and the ordinal cognitive function variables was studied using the proportional-odds model. Results: After adjustment for age, sex, education, total energy intake, cigarrette smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity, a better healthy diet score was associated with a lower prevalence of cognitive deficit. The cumulative odds ratio was 0.85 (95% CI 0.77-0.93). Conclusions: Our results suggest an association beween a globally satisfactory diet and better cognitive performance in the elderly. However, the specific aspects of a 'healthy diet' for the elderly should be clarified.},

In this aspect, the present study aimed to critically analyze the current epidemiological evidence concerning MD adherence of university students' populations. PubMed database was comprehensively searched, using relative keywords. Students' dietary habits are moving away from MD guidelines towards unhealthy eating patterns, especially for those living away from home and even for students with a Mediterranean country origin. Most of the available studies have documented that poorer students' health status was associated with lower MD adherence. Higher MD adherence was correlated with lower depression risk, while higher perceived stress score with lower fruit and vegetables intake. The access of students to information and knowledge provided by courses and lectures did not effectively enhance their compliance to MD. Alarmingly enough, the majority of students, even from medical and nutritional university departments, showed inadequate knowledge on healthy eating habits. Due to the influence of diet on the quality of life and the mental and physical health of students, it is crucial to redirect research focus on this important aspect.},

abstract = {Maternal obesity carries significant health risks for offspring that manifest later in life, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and affective disorders. Programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis during development mediates both metabolic homeostasis and the response to psychosocial stress in offspring. A diet high in fat alters maternal systemic corticosterone levels, but effects in offspring on limbic brain areas regulating the HPA axis and anxiety behavior are poorly understood. In addition to their role in the response to psychosocial stress, corticosteroid receptors form part of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway comprising downstream inflammatory processes. Increased systemic inflammation is a hallmark of high-fat diet exposure, though altered expression of these genes in limbic brain areas has not been examined. We studied the influence of high-fat diet exposure during pre-weaning development in rats on gene expression in the amygdala and hippocampus by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), anxiety behavior in the Open field, elevated plus maze and light-dark transition tasks, and corticosterone levels in response to stress by radioimmunoassay. As adults, offspring exposed to perinatal high-fat diet show increased expression of corticosterone receptors in the amygdala and altered pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory expression in the hippocampus and amygdala in genes known to be regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor. These changes were associated with increased anxiety behavior, decreased basal corticosterone levels and a slower return to baseline levels following a stress challenge. The data indicate that the dietary environment during development programs glucocorticoid signaling pathways in limbic areas relevant for the regulation of HPA function and anxiety behavior. {\textcopyright} 2013 IBRO.},

abstract = {Background: Many patients with depression are reluctant to take psychiatric medications. Hence, complementary therapies such as nutritional considerations could be advantageous. The antidepressant potential of olive oil has been proved in observational studies. Objective: The effect of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) on depression symptoms and cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in patients with depression was examined. Design and participants: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted on 73 patients suffering from major depressive disorder in Shiraz, Iran, in 2016. Intervention: The patients were randomly assigned to intervention (EVOO) and control (sunflower oil) groups and consumed 25 mL/d of the corresponding oil for 52 days. Main outcome measures: Depression symptoms were assessed by Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and 7-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-7). Salivary cortisol levels were determined immediately after awakening and 30 minutes later. Cortisol awakening response and the area under the curve with respect to ground and increase were computed. Serum BDNF concentrations were also measured. Statistical analyses performed: Statistical analysis was conducted based on intention-to-treat and per-protocol approaches. Within-group changes were examined with repeated measures (for BDI-II and HAMD-7) and with paired t test (for other variables). Between-group comparisons were performed with analysis of covariance after adjustment for confounding factors. Results: In intention-to-treat analysis, HAMD-7 score was the only variable with significant changes within and between groups, the latter as a greater decline in EVOO group (P =.001). BDI-II score did not show significant change in either group but the between-group comparison revealed a significant difference (P =.021). EVOO showed antidepressant effect in severely depressed patients (P =.017 for BDI-II and 0.008 for HAMD-7) but not in mild/moderate depression category. Serum BDNF concentrations, salivary cortisol levels at immediately after awakening (T0) and 30 minutes later, cortisol awakening response, the area under the curve with respect to ground and increase did not change within or between groups. Results of per-protocol analysis were not different. Conclusions: The results of this study suggested beneficial effects of EVOO on depression symptoms in patients with severe depression but not in those with mild to moderate depression. The effects were significant from both statistical and clinical points of view.},

abstract = {Aim: The aim of the research was to assess the fatty acid content and atherogenicity of daily food rations in patients with recurrent depressive disorders in the aspect of risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Methods: The study included 126 persons (62 persons with diagnosed recurrent depressive disorders and 64 healthy volunteers). A 24-hour recall was used in the quantitative assessment of the diet. Anthropometric and chemical measurements as well as body composition analysis were used to assess the nutritional status. Results: The diets of 40% of tested women and 55% of men were atherogenic, according to an assessment using Keys' index. The proportion between the PUFA and SFA content was 0.3 (women) and 0.2 (men) with recommended values of = 1. In the group of women there were no significant correlations between the selected clinical features of the illness and components of diet and biochemical data of nutritional status. It was only observed that a higher intensity of depressive symptoms had a significantly negative effect on the glucose concentration in the women's blood. It was also observed that in the group of women suffering from depression, the total consumption of fats and cholesterol content in the food decreased with age. No statistically significant correlations between the assessed variables were observed in the group of men taking part in the study. Conclusions: The improper energy structure and the composition of the subjects' food rations may contribute to the development of the cardiovascular system diseases in the future and make it difficult to maintain mental health at the same time.},

We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of 34 controlled clinical trials evaluating the effects of prebiotics and probiotics on depression and anxiety. Prebiotics did not differ from placebo for depression (d = −.08, p =.51) or anxiety (d =.12, p =.11). Probiotics yielded small but significant effects for depression (d = −.24, p <.01) and anxiety (d = −.10, p =.03). Sample type was a moderator for probiotics and depression, with a larger effect observed for clinical/medical samples (d = −.45, p <.001) than community ones. This effect increased to medium-to-large in a preliminary analysis restricted to psychiatric samples (d = −.73, p <.001). There is general support for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of probiotics, but the pooled effects were reduced by the paucity of trials with clinical samples. Additional randomized clinical trials with psychiatric samples are necessary fully to evaluate their therapeutic potential.},

Recent clinical and animal studies have identified nutritional intervention as a viable method to curtail the cognitive aging process. Human studies have been primarily observational and have indicated that inclusion of antioxidant-rich foods in the diet can slow the progression of cognitive decline. Basic science studies investigating nutritional modulation of age-related cognitive decline have focused on foods rich in antioxidants or essential fatty acids. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent advancements in animal research showing that age-related cognitive and behavioral decline can be ameliorated with nutritional supplementation with polyphenol- or polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich plant foods. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Society for Nutrition.},

Among 15 546 Spanish university graduates from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) prospective cohort study, diet was assessed with a validated 136-item semi-quantitative FFQ at baseline and at 10-year follow-up. Cumulative average consumption of added sugars, sweetened drinks and an overall carbohydrate quality index (CQI) were calculated. A better CQI was associated with higher whole-grain consumption and fibre intake and lower glycaemic index and consumption of solid (instead of liquid) carbohydrates. Clinical diagnoses of depression during follow-up were classified as incident cases. Multivariable time-dependent Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of depression according to consumption of added sugars, sweetened drinks and CQI. We observed 769 incident cases of depression. Participants in the highest quartile of added sugars consumption showed a significant increment in the risk of depression (HR=1{\textperiodcentered}35; 95 % CI 1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}67, P=0{\textperiodcentered}034), whereas those in the highest quartile of CQI (upper quartile of the CQI) showed a relative risk reduction of 30 % compared with those in the lowest quartile of the CQI (HR=0{\textperiodcentered}70; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}56, 0{\textperiodcentered}88). No significant association between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and depression risk was found. Higher added sugars and lower quality of carbohydrate consumption were associated with depression risk in the SUN Cohort. Further studies are necessary to confirm the reported results.},

abstract = {Background: Studies of single nutrients on depression have produced inconsistent results, and they have failed to consider the complex interactions between nutrients. An increasing number of studies in recent years are investigating the association of overall dietary patterns and depression. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review current literature and conduct meta-analyses of studies addressing the association between dietary patterns and depression. Design: Six electronic databases were searched for articles published up to August 2013 that examined the association of total diet and depression among adults. Only studies considered methodologically rigorous were included. Two independent reviewers completed study selection, quality rating, and data extraction. Effect sizes of eligible studies were pooled by using random-effects models. A summary of the findings was presented for studies that could not be meta-analyzed. Results: A total of 21 studies were identified. Results from 13 observational studies were pooled. Two dietary patterns were identified. The healthy diet pattern was significantly associated with a reduced odds of depression (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.92; P < 0.001). No statistically significant association was observed between the Western diet and depression (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.68; P = 0.094); however, the studies were too few for a precise estimate of this effect. Conclusions: The results suggest that high intakes of fruit, vegetables, fish, and whole grains may be associated with a reduced depression risk. However, more high-quality randomized controlled trials and cohort studies are needed to confirm this finding, specifically the temporal sequence of this association. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract = {Studies have shown an association between depression and both antioxidant levels and oxidant stress, but generally have not included intakes of antioxidants and antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables. This study examined the cross-sectional associations between clinically diagnosed depression and intakes of antioxidants, fruits, and vegetables in a cohort of older adults. Antioxidant, fruit, and vegetable intakes were assessed in 278 elderly participants (144 with depression, 134 without depression) using a Block 1998 food frequency questionnaire that was administered between 1999 and 2007. All participants were aged 60 years or older. Vitamin C, lutein, and beta cryptoxanthin intakes were significantly lower among individuals with depression than in comparison participants (P<0.05). In addition, fruit and vegetable consumption, a primary determinant of antioxidant intake, was lower in individuals with depression. In multivariable models controlling for age, sex, education, vascular comorbidity score, body mass index, total dietary fat, and alcohol; vitamin C, beta cryptoxanthin, fruits, and vegetables remained significant. Antioxidants from dietary supplements were not associated with depression. Antioxidant, fruit, and vegetable intakes were lower in individuals with late-life depression than in comparison participants. These associations may partially explain the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease among older individuals with depression. In addition, these findings point to the importance of antioxidant food sources rather than dietary supplements. {\textcopyright} 2012 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Research on the role of diet in the prevention of depression is scarce. Some evidence suggests that depression shares common mechanisms with cardiovascular disease. DISCUSSION Before considering the role of diet in the prevention of depression, several points need to be considered. First, in general, evidence has been found for the effects of isolated nutrients or foods, and not for dietary patterns. Second, most previous studies have a cross-sectional design. Third, information is generally collected though questionnaires, increasing the risk of misclassification bias. Fourth, adequate control of confounding factors in observational studies is mandatory. SUMMARY Only a few cohort studies have analyzed the relationship between overall dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, and primary prevention of depression. They have found similar results to those obtained for the role of this dietary pattern in cardiovascular disease. To confirm the findings obtained in these initial cohort studies, we need further observational longitudinal studies with improved methodology, as well as large randomized primary prevention trials, with interventions based on changes in the overall food pattern, that include participants at high risk of mental disorders.},

abstract = {AIM To investigate the relation between plain water drinking and risk of depression and anxiety among a large sample of Iranian adults. METHODS A total of 3327 Iranian general adults were included in this cross-sectional study. Validated Iranian version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. Water consumption was assessed by asking about the number of glasses of water that consumed daily. Water consumption was categorized into < 2, 2-5, and ≥ 5 glasses of water/d. RESULTS In the crude model, the lowest level of water drinking (< 2 glasses/d) compared with reference group (≥ 5 glasses/d) doubled the risk of depression and anxiety (P < 0.0001). After adjusting potential confounders, this inverse link remained significant for depression (OR: 1.79; 95%CI: 1.32, 2.42; P < 0.0001), but not for anxiety (OR: 1.49; 95%CI: 0.98, 2.25; P = 0.109). In stratified analyses by sex, after controlling for potential confounders, water drinking < 2 glasses/d was associated with 73% and 54% increment in the risk of depression in men and women, respectively (P < 0.05), whilst no significant association was observed for anxiety either in men or in women. CONCLUSION We found inverse associations between plain water consumption and depression. Also, these findings showed a tended risky association, but not statistically significant, between lower levels of water consumption and anxiety. These findings warrant evaluation in prospective and clinical trials studies to establish the plausible role of water in mental health status.},

abstract = {Objective Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between adherence to different Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet indices and the risk of depression. Design In a prospective study we assessed 14051 participants of a dynamic (permanently ongoing recruitment) prospective cohort (the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) Project), initially free of depression. At baseline, a validated FFQ was used to assess adherence to four previously proposed DASH indices (Dixon, Mellen, Fung and G{\"{u}}nther). To define the outcome we applied two definitions of depression: a less conservative definition including only self-reported physician-diagnosed depression (410 incident cases) and a more conservative definition that required both clinical diagnosis of depression and use of antidepressants (113 incident cases). Cox regression and restricted cubic splines analyses were performed. Results After a median follow-up period of 8 years, the multiple-adjusted model showed an inverse association with the Fung DASH score (hazard ratio (HR)=0{\textperiodcentered}76; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}61, 0{\textperiodcentered}94) when we used the less conservative definition of depression, and also under the more conservative definition (HR=0{\textperiodcentered}63; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}41, 0{\textperiodcentered}95). We observed a weak inverse association with the Mellen DASH score, but no statistically significant association was found for the other definitions. The restricted cubic splines analyses suggested that these associations were non-linear (U-shaped). Conclusions Moderate adherence to the DASH diet as operationalized by Fung and Mellen was related to lower depression risk. Since these associations were non-linear, additional prospective studies are required before the results can be generalized and clinical recommendations can be given.},

abstract = {Major depression is a common mental disorder among women. A number of studies have demonstrated the association between some nutrients and food items with depression, but the studies on the association of dietary patterns with depression, especially in the Middle East, are rare. Further, the literature examining the relationship between anthropometric status and depression are inconsistent. In this study, 45 women with major depression and 90 patients with no mental disorder participated. We collected dietary intakes by a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and measured anthropometric indices (weight, height, waist and hip circumferences). Using factor analysis, two major dietary patterns were extracted: Healthy and Unhealthy. After adjusting for confounders, individuals who gained higher scores in healthy dietary pattern, had 84% lower odds of major depression; while the odds of major depression in participants who gained higher scores in unhealthy dietary pattern showed no significant association. No significant association was found between anthropometric indices and major depression. These results suggest that the healthy dietary pattern is significantly associated with lower odds of major depression in adult women. Further researches are needed to confirm these findings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Food addiction posits that highly processed foods may be capable of triggering addictive-like symptoms in some individuals, including withdrawal. The current study developed and assessed the psychometric properties of the first self-report measure of highly processed food withdrawal. Individuals (n = 231) aged 19–68 (51.9% female) were recruited online through Amazon Mechanical Turk and reported cutting down on highly processed foods in the past year. The Highly Processed Food Withdrawal Scale (ProWS) was adapted from self-report measures of drug withdrawal and internal consistency and validity were evaluated. Paralleling the course of drug withdrawal, symptoms assessed by the ProWS were reported as most intense between days 2–5 during an attempt to cut down. The ProWS demonstrated convergent validity with addictive-like eating (r = 0.48, p <.001), body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.16, p =.02), and weight cycling (r = 0.29, p <.001) and discriminant validity with dietary restraint: (r = −0.13, p =.04). The ProWS explained 11.2% of variance in self-reported success in last diet attempt beyond addictive-like eating and BMI. The ProWS seems to be a psychometrically sound tool for future research investigating highly processed food withdrawal in humans, and the present data may provide preliminary insight into the plausibility of withdrawal symptoms occurring in response to cutting down on highly processed foods.},

We performed a systematic review of observational studies examining the relationship between dietary patterns and depression in healthy adults. METHODS A literature research was conducted searching various electronic databases up to May 2013. Study selection was based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included studies were reviewed, and relevant data were extracted by two independent researchers. Due to a high level of heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was conducted. Therefore, main results are presented in a descriptive way. RESULTS In total, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria and are part of this review. Dietary patterns most commonly found were traditional/healthy patterns, Western/unhealthy patterns and Mediterranean patterns. The available literature suggests a protective effect of healthy and Mediterranean patterns, as well as a potential positive association of Western patterns and depression. However, comparison of the included studies was difficult, due to differences in relevant study characteristics and methodological limitations. CONCLUSIONS There are indications that dietary patterns may have influence on the onset of depression, but no firm conclusion can be drawn at this point. Further research is needed to clarify the diet-depression relationship, preferably in the form of methodological strong prospective studies using more homogeneous methods.},

abstract = {Prevention of major depressive disorder is important because current treatments are only partially adequate in reducing symptom burden and promoting health-related quality of life. Lifestyle interventions may be a desirable prevention strategy for reasons of patient preference, particularly among older patients from minority groups. Using evidence from a randomized depression prevention trial for older adults, the authors found that coaching in healthy dietary practices was potentially effective in protecting at-risk older adults from developing incident episodes of major depression. The authors describe the dietary coaching program (highlighted in a case example) as well as the feasibility and potential efficacy of the program within the context of evidence-based interventions for preventing episodes of major depression and mitigating symptoms of depression. Older adults receiving dietary coaching experienced a low incidence of major depressive episodes and exhibited a 40%250% decrease in depressive symptoms, as well as enhanced well-being, during the initial 6-week intervention; these gains were sustained over 2 years. The authors also describe why lifestyle interventions like coaching in healthy dietary practicesmay hold promise as effective, practical, nonstigmatizing interventions for preventing episodes of major depressive disorder in older adults with subsyndromal depressive symptoms.},

abstract = {Background: Mental disorders influence diet and food consumption, but there is a lack of consistent findings. Aims: To investigate food consumption, nutrient intakes and serum metabolic biomarkers in depressive, anxiety and alcohol use disorders in comparison with the remaining from a population-based nationwide sample. Methods: The study was based on the Health 2000 Survey data of which 5504 subjects aged 30 and over (3009 women and 2495 men) were used for the analysis. Depressive disorder, anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorders were diagnosed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (M-CIDI). The consumption of food and beverage items, and nutrient intakes were measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire, and the concentrations of biomarkers were determined in blood samples. Results: Overall, no similar differences with both genders were found in the intakes of energy, dietary fibre or macronutrients or in biomarkers in depressive or anxiety disorders. Women suffering from depressed disorder consumed more soft drinks (P = 0.034) and women suffering from anxiety disorders consumed more oils (P = 0.001), polyunsaturated fatty acids (P = 0.001) and less potatoes (P = 0.002) than the remaining participants. Men suffering from depressive disorder consumed less sweets and chocolate (P = 0.001) and men with anxiety disorder consumed more tea (P = 0.033) compared with the remaining participants. In alcohol use disorders, the intake of carbohydrate was lower in both genders (P = 0.001 for women, P = 0.001 for men). Conclusions: A difference in the usual diet exists between individuals with alcohol use disorders and the remaining participants on a population level. No consistent difference in both genders between those with depressive or anxiety disorders and the remaining was found. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa Healthcare.},

Broad-spectrum multi-vitamin/mineral approaches have been found to alleviate a number of psychiatric symptoms. We investigated the effects of a nutrient intervention program, which includes optimizing vitamin D levels, on depression and anxiety outcomes from community-based program. Methods: We evaluated self-reported health measures of depression and anxiety collected as part of a community-based program focused on optimizing overall health through nutritional supplementation, education and lifestyle advice. Results: Data were collected from 16,020 participants, with measures including European Quality of Life Five Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Targeted Symptoms List (TSL) providing self-reported depression and anxiety. More than 56% of participants were identified as having elevated levels of depression and anxiety at baseline as reported on the EQ-5D. After one year in the program, 49.2% (n = 7878) of participants who reported any level of depression or anxiety at baseline reported improvement at follow-up. Of those who reported severe/extreme depression at baseline (n = 829), 97.2% reported improvement after one year. Regression analyses revealed a significant association of improvement in depression and anxiety with higher vitamin D status (>100 nmol/L) and more strenuous physical activity. Conclusion: Overall, people from the general population who suffer from mood and anxiety problems may benefit from improved nutritional status achieved with nutritional supplements.},

abstract = {The changing of omega-6/omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the food supply of Western societies occurred over the last 150 years is thought to promote the pathogenesis of many inflammatory-related diseases, including depressive disorders. Several epidemiological studies reported a significant inverse correlation between intake of oily fish and depression or bipolar disorders. Studies conducted specifically on the association between omega-3 intake and depression reported contrasting results, suggesting that the preventive role of omega-3 PUFA may depend also on other factors, such as overall diet quality and the social environment. Accordingly, tertiary prevention with omega-3 PUFA supplement in depressed patients has reached greater effectiveness during the last recent years, although definitive statements on their use in depression therapy cannot be yet freely asserted. Among the biological properties of omega-3 PUFA, their anti-inflammatory effects and their important role on the structural changing of the brain should be taken into account to better understand the possible pathway through which they can be effective both in preventing or treating depression. However, the problem of how to correct the inadequate supply of omega-3 PUFA in the Westernized countries' diet is a priority in order to set food and health policies and also dietary recommendations for individuals and population groups. {\textcopyright} 2014 Giuseppe Grosso et al.},

@article{Clark2016,
abstract = {Fatigue, mood disturbances, under performance and gastrointestinal distress are common among athletes during training and competition. The psychosocial and physical demands during intense exercise can initiate a stress response activating the sympathetic-adrenomedullary and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes, resulting in the release of stress and catabolic hormones, inflammatory cytokines and microbial molecules. The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in many aspects of human biology, including metabolism, endocrine, neuronal and immune function. The gut microbiome and its influence on host behavior, intestinal barrier and immune function are believed to be a critical aspect of the brain-gut axis. Recent evidence in murine models shows that there is a high correlation between physical and emotional stress during exercise and changes in gastrointestinal microbiota composition. For instance, induced exercise-stress decreased cecal levels of Turicibacter spp and increased Ruminococcus gnavus, which have well defined roles in intestinal mucus degradation and immune function. Diet is known to dramatically modulate the composition of the gut microbiota. Due to the considerable complexity of stress responses in elite athletes (from leaky gut to increased catabolism and depression), defining standard diet regimes is difficult. However, some preliminary experimental data obtained from studies using probiotics and prebiotics studies show some interesting results, indicating that the microbiota acts like an endocrine organ (e.g. secreting serotonin, dopamine or other neurotransmitters) and may control the HPA axis in athletes. What is troubling is that dietary recommendations for elite athletes are primarily based on a low consumption of plant polysaccharides, which is associated with reduced microbiota diversity and functionality (e.g. less synthesis of byproducts such as short chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters). As more elite athletes suffer from psychological and gastrointestinal conditions that can be linked to the gut, targeting the microbiota therapeutically may need to be incorporated in athletes' diets that take into consideration dietary fiber as well as microbial taxa not currently present in athlete's gut.},

Methods: Participants were 1977 employees ages 19-69 y. Dietary intake was assessed via a validated, brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of depressive symptoms adjusted for a range of dietary and non-dietary potential confounders. Results: Dietary fiber intake from vegetables and fruits was significantly inversely associated with depressive symptoms. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the lowest through the highest tertile of vegetable and fruit fiber were 1.00 (reference), 0.80 (0.60-1.05), and 0.65 (0.45-0.95), respectively (P for trend = 0.03). Dietary intake of total, soluble, insoluble, and cereal fiber was not associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Higher dietary fiber intake from vegetables and fruits may be associated with lower likelihood of having depressive symptoms.},

However, the nature and the underlying mechanisms of the association are still unclear. This study examines the association between depressive and anxiety disorders and obesity, physical activity, and social activity, and examines whether social and physical activity are potential influencing factors in the association between depressive and anxiety disorders and obesity. Method: Cross-sectional data were used from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. A total of 1,854 women and 955 men aged 18-65 years were recruited from the community, general practices, and specialized mental health care. Depressive and anxiety disorders were determined with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Body mass index (BMI<30 kg/m2) was used to determine obesity. Physical and social activities were measured by self-report. Results: The odds of obesity adjusted for covariates was significantly higher among those with a current pure Major Depressive Disorder (MDD;odds ratio [OR] OR:1.43; 95% CI:1.07-1.92) compared to controls. Physical activity and social activities were lower among persons with depressive and anxiety disorders compared to controls. The association between MDD and obesity was influenced by social and physical activities. Conclusion: This study confirmed a link between depressive disorders and obesity that was influenced by lower social and physical activities among the depressed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Anxiety is a serious personal health condition and represents a substantial burden to overall quality of life. Additionally anxiety disorders represent a significant cost to the health care system as well as employers through benefits coverage and days missed due to incapacity. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of naturopathic care on anxiety symptoms using a randomized trial. Methods: Employees with moderate to severe anxiety of longer than 6 weeks duration were randomized based on age and gender to receive naturopathic care (NC) (n = 41) or standardized psychotherapy intervention (PT) (n = 40) over a period of 12 weeks. Blinding of investigators and participants during randomization and allocation was maintained. Participants in the NC group received dietary counseling, deep breathing relaxation techniques, a standard multi-vitamin, and the herbal medicine, ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) (300 mg b.i.d. standardized to 1.5% withanolides, prepared from root). The PT intervention received psychotherapy, and matched deep breathing relaxation techniques, and placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and secondary outcome measures included the Short Form 36 (SF-36), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile (MY-MOP) to measure anxiety, mental health, and quality of life respectively. Participants were blinded to the placebo-controlled intervention. Results: Seventy-five participants (93%) were followed for 8 or more weeks on the trial. Final BAI scores decreased by 56.5% (p<0.0001) in the NC group and 30.5% (p<0.0001) in the PT group. BAI group scores were significantly decreased in the NC group compared to PT group (p=0.003). Significant differences between groups were also observed in mental health, concentration, fatigue, social functioning, vitality, and overall quality of life with the NC group exhibiting greater clinical benefit. No serious adverse reactions were observed in either group. Relevance: Many patients seek alternatives and/or complementary care to conventional anxiety treatments. To date, no study has evaluated the potential of a naturopathic treatment protocol to effectively treat anxiety. Knowledge of the efficacy, safety or risk of natural health products, and naturopathic treatments is important for physicians and the public in order to make informed decisions. Interpretation: Both NC and PT led to significant improvements in patients' anxiety. Group comparison demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety levels in the NC group over the PT group. Significant improvements in secondary quality of life measures were also observed in the NC group as compared to PT. The whole system of naturopathic care for anxiety needs to be investigated further including a closer examination of the individual components within the context of their additive effect. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cooley et al.},

abstract = {According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4 out of the 10 leading causes of disability in the US and other developed countries are mental disorders. Major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are among the most common mental disorders that currently plague numerous countries and have varying incidence rates from 26 percent in America to 4 percent in China. Though some of this difference may be attributable to the manner in which individual healthcare providers diagnose mental disorders, this noticeable distribution can be also explained by studies which show that a lack of certain dietary nutrients contribute to the development of mental disorders. Notably, essential vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids are often deficient in the general population in America and other developed countries; and are exceptionally deficient in patients suffering from mental disorders. Studies have shown that daily supplements of vital nutrients often effectively reduce patients' symptoms. Supplements that contain amino acids also reduce symptoms, because they are converted to neurotransmitters that alleviate depression and other mental disorders. Based on emerging scientific evidence, this form of nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for controlling major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, eating disorders, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), addiction, and autism. The aim of this manuscript is to emphasize which dietary supplements can aid the treatment of the four most common mental disorders currently affecting America and other developed countries: major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Most antidepressants and other prescription drugs cause severe side effects, which usually discourage patients from taking their medications. Such noncompliant patients who have mental disorders are at a higher risk for committing suicide or being institutionalized. One way for psychiatrists to overcome this noncompliance is to educate themselves about alternative or complementary nutritional treatments. Although in the cases of certain nutrients, further research needs to be done to determine the best recommended doses of most nutritional supplements, psychiatrists can recommend doses of dietary supplements based on previous and current efficacious studies and then adjust the doses based on the results obtained. {\textcopyright} 2008 Lakhan and Vieira; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Several nutrition, food and dietary compounds have been suggested to be involved in the onset and maintenance of depressive disorders and in the severity of depressive symptoms. Nutritional compounds might modulate depression associated biomarkers and parallel the development of depression, obesity and diabetes. In this context, recent studies revealed new mediators of both energy homeostasis and mood changes (i.e. IGF-1, NPY, BDNF, ghrelin, leptin, CCK, GLP-1, AGE, glucose metabolism and microbiota) acting in gut brain circuits. In this context several healthy foods such as olive oil, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, poultry, dairy and unprocessed meat have been inversely associated with depression risk and even have been postulated to improve depressive symptoms. In contrast, unhealthy western dietary patterns including the consumption of sweetened beverage, refined food, fried food, processed meat, refined grain, and high fat diary, biscuits, snacking and pastries have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of depression in longitudinal studies. However, it is always difficult to conclude a real prospective causal relationship from these mostly retrospective studies as depressed individuals might also change their eating habits secondarily to their depression. Additionally specific selected nutritional compounds, e.g. calcium, chromium, folate, PUFAs, vitamin D, B12, zinc, magnesium and D-serine have been postulated to be used as ad-on strategies in antidepressant treatment. In this context, dietary and lifestyle interventions may be a desirable, effective, pragmatical and non-stigmatizing prevention and treatment strategy for depression. At last, several medications (pioglitazone, metformin, exenatide, atorvastatin, gram-negative antibiotics), which have traditionally been used to treat metabolic disorders showed a certain potential to treat depression in first randomized controlled clinical trials.},

Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the relation between dietary patterns and the risk of depression. A literature research was conducted searching MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to September 2016. In total, 21 studies from ten countries met the inclusion criteria and were included in the present meta-analysis. A dietary pattern characterized by a high intakes of fruit, vegetables, whole grain, fish, olive oil, low-fat dairy and antioxidants and low intakes of animal foods was apparently associated with a decreased risk of depression. A dietary pattern characterized by a high consumption of red and/or processed meat, refined grains, sweets, high-fat dairy products, butter, potatoes and high-fat gravy, and low intakes of fruits and vegetables is associated with an increased risk of depression. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that healthy pattern may decrease the risk of depression, whereas western-style may increase the risk of depression. However, more randomized controlled trails and cohort studies are urgently required to confirm this findings.},

Since its publication, our results have been largely replicated and our recent economic evaluation of SMILES suggests that the benefits of our approach extend beyond depression.

abstract = {With depression being the psychiatric disorder incurring the largest societal costs in developed countries, there is a need to gather evidence on the role of nutrition in depression, to help develop recommendations and guide future psychiatric health care. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the link between diet quality, measured using a range of predefined indices, and depressive outcomes. Medline, Embase and PsychInfo were searched up to 31st May 2018 for studies that examined adherence to a healthy diet in relation to depressive symptoms or clinical depression. Where possible, estimates were pooled using random effect meta-analysis with stratification by observational study design and dietary score. A total of 20 longitudinal and 21 cross-sectional studies were included. These studies utilized an array of dietary measures, including: different measures of adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and Alternative HEI (AHEI), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and the Dietary Inflammatory Index. The most compelling evidence was found for the Mediterranean diet and incident depression, with a combined relative risk estimate of highest vs. lowest adherence category from four longitudinal studies of 0.67 (95% CI 0.55–0.82). A lower Dietary Inflammatory Index was also associated with lower depression incidence in four longitudinal studies (relative risk 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63–0.92). There were fewer longitudinal studies using other indices, but they and cross-sectional evidence also suggest an inverse association between healthy diet and depression (e.g., relative risk 0.65; 95% CI 0.50–0.84 for HEI/AHEI). To conclude, adhering to a healthy diet, in particular a traditional Mediterranean diet, or avoiding a pro-inflammatory diet appears to confer some protection against depression in observational studies. This provides a reasonable evidence base to assess the role of dietary interventions to prevent depression. This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under the number CRD42017080579.},

abstract = {The emerging role of chronic inflammation in the major degenerative diseases of modern society has stimulated research into the influence of nutrition and dietary patterns on inflammatory indices. Most human studies have correlated analyses of habitual dietary intake as determined by a food frequency questionnaire or 24-hour recall with systemic markers of inflammation like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-$\alpha$). An occasional study also includes nutrition analysis of blood components. There have been several controlled interventions which evaluated the effect of a change in dietary pattern or of single foods on inflammatory markers in defined populations. Most studies reveal a modest effect of dietary composition on some inflammatory markers in free-living adults, although different markers do not vary in unison. Significant dietary influences have been established for glycemic index (GI) and load (GL), fiber, fatty acid composition, magnesium, carotenoids, and flavonoids. A traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern, which typically has a high ratio of monounsaturated (MUFA) to saturated (SFA) fats and $\omega$-3 to $\omega$-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs) and supplies an abundance of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains, has shown anti-inflammatory effects when compared with typical North American and Northern European dietary patterns in most observational and interventional studies and may become the diet of choice for diminishing chronic inflammation in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is the single largest contributor to global disability. There is growing evidence that a healthy diet is associated with reduced depression risk. However, beyond the Mediterranean diet, few longitudinal studies have explored the relationship between adherence to national dietary guidelines and depression. Hence, this study investigates the relationship between adherence to Australian Dietary Guidelines and depressive symptoms. Methods: Data was drawn from the READI longitudinal study, a prospective cohort study of socioeconomically disadvantaged Australian women. This analysis includes a sub-sample of 837 women. A generalized linear model was used to explore whether baseline diet (assessed using the Dietary Guideline Index (DGI-2013; score range 0 to 85)) was associated with risk of developing depressive symptoms (measured by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D)) at 5 years follow-up, whilst adjusting for potential confounders. A fixed-effects model was used to assess associations between concurrent changes in diet quality and depressive symptoms from baseline to 5 years follow-up. Results: An association between baseline diet quality and risk of developing depressive symptoms at follow-up was observed, where a 10 unit increase in DGI-2013 score was associated with an estimated 12% lower risk of developing heightened depressive symptoms (RR = 0.875, 95%CI 0.784 to 0.978, p = 0.018). The fixed-effects model indicated that an increase in DGI score over 5 years follow-up was associated with a lower (improved) CES-D score (B = -0.044, 95% CI - 0.08 to - 0.01, p = 0.024). Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that better adherence to the Australian Dietary Guidelines may result in improved depressive symptoms. The growing high-quality evidence regarding the diet-depression relationship provides us with a rationale for developing strategies for supporting dietary behaviour change programs to lower depression rates.},

Nutritional deficiencies often result in impaired function, and, conversely, intakes at recommended levels can resume or further enhance body functions. An increasing number of studies are revealing that diet and nutrition are critical not only for physiology and body composition, but also have significant effects on mood and mental well-being. In particular, Western dietary habits have been the object of several research studies focusing on the relationship between nutrition and mental health. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between the intake of specific micro- and macronutrients, including eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, alpha-tocopherol, magnesium and folic acid, and mental health, with particular reference to their beneficial effect on stress, sleep disorders, anxiety, mild cognitive impairment, as well as on neuropsychiatric disorders, all significantly affecting the quality of life of an increasing number of people. Overall data support a positive role for the nutrients mentioned above in the preservation of normal brain function and mental well-being, also through the control of neuroinflammation, and encourage their integration in a well-balanced and varied diet, accompanied by a healthy lifestyle. This strategy is of particular importance when considering the global human aging and that the brain suffers significantly from the life-long impact of stress factors.},

abstract = {Over the last decades, there has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of mental health disorders, including an increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, cognitive, and sleep disorders. Diet and its bioactive components have been recognized among the modifiable risk factors, possibly influencing their pathogenesis. This review aimed to summarize molecular mechanisms underlying the putative beneficial effects toward brain health of different dietary factors, such as micro- and macronutrient intake and habits, such as feeding time and circadian rhythm. The role of hormonal homeostasis in the context of glucose metabolism and adiponectin regulation and its impact on systemic and neuro-inflammation has also been considered and deepened. In addition, the effect of individual bioactive molecules exerting antioxidant activities and acting as anti-inflammatory agents, such as omega-3 fatty acids and polyphenols, considered beneficial for the central nervous system via modulation of adult neurogenesis, synaptic and neuronal plasticity, and microglia activation has been summarized. An overview of the regulation of the gut–brain axis and its effect on the modulation of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress has been provided. Finally, the impact of bioactive molecules on inflammation and oxidative stress and its association with brain health has been summarized.},

Among 15 546 Spanish university graduates from the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) prospective cohort study, diet was assessed with a validated 136-item semi-quantitative FFQ at baseline and at 10-year follow-up. Cumulative average consumption of added sugars, sweetened drinks and an overall carbohydrate quality index (CQI) were calculated. A better CQI was associated with higher whole-grain consumption and fibre intake and lower glycaemic index and consumption of solid (instead of liquid) carbohydrates. Clinical diagnoses of depression during follow-up were classified as incident cases. Multivariable time-dependent Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) of depression according to consumption of added sugars, sweetened drinks and CQI. We observed 769 incident cases of depression. Participants in the highest quartile of added sugars consumption showed a significant increment in the risk of depression (HR=1{\textperiodcentered}35; 95 % CI 1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}67, P=0{\textperiodcentered}034), whereas those in the highest quartile of CQI (upper quartile of the CQI) showed a relative risk reduction of 30 % compared with those in the lowest quartile of the CQI (HR=0{\textperiodcentered}70; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}56, 0{\textperiodcentered}88). No significant association between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and depression risk was found. Higher added sugars and lower quality of carbohydrate consumption were associated with depression risk in the SUN Cohort. Further studies are necessary to confirm the reported results.},

abstract = {The prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes in adults is increasing. Although beneficial effects of selected micronutrients and foods on mental health have been reported, they do not reflect the impact of the habitual diet on mental health. Therefore, our objective is to examine potential associations between dietary quality, dietary composition and compliance with food pyramid recommendations with depressive symptoms, anxiety and well-being (assessed using CES-D, HADS-A and WHO-5 screening tools) in a cross-sectional sample of 2047 middle-aged adults. Diet was assessed using a self-completed FFQ. Chi-square tests, t-tests and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations between dietary components and mental health outcomes. Dietary quality, but not dietary composition or guideline adherence, was associated with well-being. Those with high dietary quality were more likely to report well-being (OR =1.67, 95% CI 1.15-2.44, p = 0.007) relative to those with low dietary quality. This remained significant among females (OR = 1.92, (95% CI 1.14-3.23, p = 0.014) and non-obese individuals (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.28-3.20, p = 0.003). No associations between any dietary measures with anxiety or depressive symptoms were observed. These novel results highlight the importance of dietary quality in maintaining optimal psychological well-being. Better understanding of the relationship between dietary quality and mental health may provide insight into potential therapeutic or intervention strategies to improve mental health and well-being.},

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to explore their association. Methods: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 to 2014 were used in this cross-sectional study. Dietary data were obtained through two 24-h dietary recall interviews. Depressive symptoms were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire. Logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline models were applied to evaluate the associations among dietary intakes of total, cereal, vegetable, and fruit fiber and depressive symptoms. Results: A total of 16 807 adults ages 20 y or older were included in this study. Dietary intakes of total, cereal, vegetable, and fruit fiber were inversely associated with depressive symptoms in unadjusted model and multivariate-adjusted model 1. In multivariate-adjusted model 2, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of depressive symptoms were 0.59 (0.44–0.79), 0.90 (0.69–1.19), 0.58 (0.45–0.76), and 0.64 (0.45–0.92) for the highest versus lowest quartile of total, cereal, vegetable, and fruit fiber intakes, respectively. Dose-response analyses found that the risk of depressive symptoms was associated with total fiber intake in a nonlinear manner, whereas the relationships were linear with cereal, vegetable, and fruit fiber intakes. Conclusions: Our study suggested that intakes of total fiber, vegetable fiber, and fruit fiber were inversely associated with depressive symptoms. Further larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

abstract = {Background: Depression and anxiety have been inconsistently associated with diabetes. Sex differences in the biological and behavioral correlates of these forms of distress could partially explain these inconsistencies. We investigated sexspecific associations between depression/anxiety symptoms and diabetes in two separate samples. Methods: The First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey enrolled 3233 participants aged 25 to 74 years from 1971 to 1974. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured via General Well Being schedule subscales. Incident diabetes for 17 years was defined by the following: a) death certificate, b) participant self-report, or c) health care facility discharge. The Detroit Neighborhood Health Study enrolled 1054 participants 18 years or older from 2008 to 2010. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 assessed depression and anxiety. Participants' self-reported physician-diagnosed prevalent diabetes. Results: In the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the risk ratio (RR; 95% confidence interval) for incident diabetes among men with high versus low anxiety symptoms was 0.85 (0.56-1.29) and that among women was 2.19 (1.17-4.09; p for interaction =.005). RRs comparing high versus low depressive symptoms for men and women were 0.69 (0.43-1.100) and 2.11 (1.06-4.19); p for interaction =.007. In the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study, the RRs for prevalent diabetes comparing those with high versus low anxiety symptoms were 0.24 (0.02-2.42) for men and 1.62 (0.61-4.32) for women (p for interaction = <.001), whereas RRs for depression were 1.30 (0.46-3.68) for men and 2.32 (1.10-4.89) for women (p for interaction =.16). Conclusions: In two separate samples, depressive symptoms were related to increased diabetes risk among women but not men. Although less robust, findings for anxiety were differentially associated with diabetes by sex.},

abstract = {Background & aims: The relationship between diet, inflammation and mental health is of increasing interest. However, limited data regarding the role of dietary inflammatory potential in this context exist. Therefore the aim of this work was to examine associations between the inflammatory potential of habitual diet and mental health outcomes in a cross-sectional sample of 2047 adults (50.8% female). Methods: Diet was assessed using a self-completed food frequency questionnaire from which dietary inflammatory index (DII{\textregistered}) scores were determined. Depressive symptoms, anxiety and well-being were assessed using the CES-D, HADS-A and WHO-5 screening tools. Results: Logistic regression analyses revealed that higher energy-adjusted DII (E-DII{\textregistered}) scores, reflecting a more pro-inflammatory diet, were associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms (odds ratios (OR) 1.70, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.23–2.35, p = 0.001) and anxiety (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15–2.24, p = 0.006) and lower likelihood of well-being (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46–0.83, p = 0.001), comparing highest to lowest tertile of E-DII. In gender-stratified analyses associations were noted in women only. Women with the highest E-DII scores were at elevated risk of depressive symptoms (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.49–3.51, p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.30–3.06, p = 0.002), while likelihood of reporting good well-being was lower (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36–0.79, p = 0.002), relative to those with the lowest E-DII scores. Conclusions: These findings, which suggest that a pro-inflammatory diet is associated with adverse mental health, may be of clinical and public health significance regarding the development of novel nutritional psychiatry approaches to promote good mental health.},

abstract = {Background Observational studies have repeatedly demonstrated relationships between habitual diet quality and depression. However, whilst reverse causality has not been the identified mechanism for these associations in prospective studies, the relationship between diet and depression is likely complex and bidirectional. Thus explicit investigation of the reverse causality hypothesis is warranted. Methods Data were drawn from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through Life Study, a longitudinal community survey following three age cohorts from Australia. Analyses evaluated the relationships between past depression and treatment, current depressive symptoms and dietary patterns. Results Individuals with current depression had lower scores on a healthy dietary pattern; however, those who had been previously depressed and sought treatment had higher scores on the healthy dietary pattern at the later baseline assessment. Moreover, those who had reported prior, but not current, depression also had lower scores on the western dietary pattern than those without prior depression, regardless of whether they had been previously treated for their symptoms. Limitations Self-report data and possible recall bias limit our conclusions. Conclusions In this study, prior depression was associated with better quality diets at the later time point. Thus, while current depression is associated with poorer dietary habits, a history of depression may prompt healthier dietary behaviours in the long term. Given the demonstrated relationships between diet quality and depressive illness, clinicians should advocate dietary improvement for their patients with depression and should not be pessimistic about the likelihood of adherence to such recommendations.},

abstract = {Severe mental illnesses (SMI), including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, are associated with increased inflammation. Given diet's role in modulating inflammatory processes, excessive calorie-dense, nutrient-deficient processed food intake may contribute toward the heightened inflammation observed in SMI. This review assesses the evidence from observational and experimental studies to investigate how diet may affect physical and mental health outcomes in SMI through inflammation-related pathways. Cross-sectional studies indicate that individuals with SMI, particularly schizophrenia, consume more pro-inflammatory foods and fewer anti-inflammatory nutrients than the general population. Cohort studies indicate that high levels of dietary inflammation are associated with increased risk of developing depression, but there is currently a lack of evidence for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Randomized controlled trials show that dietary interventions improve symptoms of depression, but none have tested the extent to which these benefits are due to changes in inflammation. This review summarizes evidence on dietary inflammation in SMI, explores the directionality of these links, and discusses the potential use of targeted nutritional interventions for improving psychological well-being and physical health outcomes in SMI. Establishing the extent to which diet explains elevated levels of inflammatory markers observed in SMI is a priority for future research.},

Nutrition is a modifiable environmental factor that might be important in prevention medicine, which have been applied for many years in the secondary prevention of heart disease with omega-3 PUFAs. This review extends the notion that nutrition in psychiatry is a modifiable environmental factor and calls for more researches on prospective clinical studies to justify the preventive application of omega-3 PUFAs in daily practice.},

The dietary intake and score of depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using a 24-h dietary recall and the 42-item depression, anxiety, stress scales questionnaire, respectively. The DDS was calculated based on the FAO 2013 guidelines. Data were analyzed using Chi-square, analysis of variance, Spearman correlation coefficient, and multivariable logistic regression tests. Results: In total, 31.4 and 25.8% of the subjects suffered from depression and stress, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, a one-unit increase in DDS was associated with a 39% reduction in the risk of severe depression. The DDS was not significantly associated with mild or moderate depression, and no significant relationship was observed between the DDS and stress. Conclusions: The DDS could be inversely associated with depression in women. Since we observed no significant relationship between stress and DDS, further studies are needed in this regard.},

We performed a meta-analysis on the association of dietary fiber intake with depression and anxiety in epidemiologic studies. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of electronic databases, up to May 2021. Data from 18 publications (12 cross-sectional, five cohort and one case–control studies) on dietary fiber consumption in relation to depression or anxiety were included. For depression, fifteen studies were conducted on adults and three others on adolescents. Anxiety was not included in the analysis, due to insufficient eligible studies. Results: Total dietary fiber intake was associated with a 10% lower odds of depression (OR = 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86, 0.95) in adults and a 57% lower odds (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.59) in adolescents. Dose–response meta-analysis revealed an inverse linear association between total dietary fiber intake and odd of depression in adults; such that each 5-g increase in total dietary fiber intake was associated with a 5% reduction in risk of depression (OR = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.97). An inverse significant association was observed between intake of fiber from vegetables (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.82) and soluble fiber (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.91) and odds of depression. However, cereal fiber, fiber from fruits and insoluble fiber were marginally associated with a reduction in having depression. Conclusions: High intake of dietary fiber was protectively associated with depression in adults, in a dose–response fashion.},

abstract = {Following recent evidence that disturbances in oxidative metabolism are involved in anxiety disorders, high anxiety levels and depression, the use of antioxidants has been proposed as a novel approach for the prevention or treatment of these conditions. Polyphenols are naturally-occurring antioxidant substances which can have pharmacological actions on the central nervous system. This mini-review aims to examine the current evidence for the potential use of dietary polyphenols as neuroprotective agents to reduce anxiety and to manage depression. I will outline recent findings which demonstrate that polyphenols have anti-anxiety effects at higher doses (300/60/30/20 mg/kg body weight) as well as at lower doses (2-4 mg/kg); this can be compared to conventional anxiolytics, which only have anxiolytic effects at lower doses (1-5 mg/kg). To circumvent problems associated with polyphenols (e.g., quercetin) having difficulty crossing the blood-brain barrier and to effectively reduce the active dose, intranasal administration in the form of liposomes could be an interesting approach. I also suggest that dietary polyphenols could be a new alternative approach to treat depression, because they exhibit antidepressant activity with relatively lower doses (0.3-2 mg/kg) than commonly-used antidepressants such as imipramine (10 mg/kg). The polyphenols discussed in this mini-review are found in vegetables and fruits such as apples, plums, cherries, onions and tea. Therefore, a varied diet that is rich in naturally-occurring polyphenols could be an effective means to prevent (or delay) anxiety, depression and other diseases linked to oxidative stress. {\textcopyright} 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.},

Men are less likely to seek help than women with only 13 % of young men aged 15-24 years seeking help for their mental health. Young men are hugely underrepresented in the current research which poses a significant issue. A 12-week randomised controlled trial will be conducted to examine the effect of a MD on the symptoms of depression in young men aged 18-25 years. Participants will be randomised to either follow a MD or receive the inactive control therapy befriending. Participants will attend three appointments at baseline, week 6 and week 12. The main outcome will be changes to the Beck's Depression Inventory score. This research aims to answer the question of whether diet can be used effectively in this population. This will be the first trial to examine the effect of a MD on the symptoms of depression in young men. This trial will help fill a significant research gap, contribute to the growing field of nutritional psychiatry, guide future research and inform advice given by clinicians to this specific demographic.},

Methods: Analyses were conducted on a sample of 4949 men and women from the Whitehall II study. Diet scores were calculated using data collected from food frequency questionnaires repeated over 11 years of exposure (1991/1993–2002/2004). Recurrence of depressive symptoms was defined when participants reported at least two episodes of depressive symptoms (assessed by Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and use of antidepressants) over the four phases of follow-up (2002/04–2015/16). Results: After adjustment for potential cofounders, higher scores on AHEI-2010, DASH and tMDS at the end of the exposure period were associated with lower risk of recurrent depressive symptoms over the 13-year follow-up. Repeat measures of dietary history showed that participants who maintained a high AHEI-2010 score over the 11-year exposure period had a 19% (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–1.00) lower odds of recurrent depressive symptoms compared to those who maintained a low AHEI score. Participants whose AHEI-2010 score decreased over time had a 1.34-fold increased odds (95% CI 1.02–1.75) of developing recurrent depressive symptoms compared to those maintaining a high AHEI-2010. No robust associations were observed for long-term tMDS and DASH. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that long-term adherence to healthy diet defined by Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010 confers protection against recurrent depressive symptoms.},

A rapidly growing number of studies in recent years support the hypothesis that the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has a beneficial effect on certain body systems, but the highly varied objectives and quality of these publications warrants an updated assessment. In the present review we performed a comprehensive evaluation of current evidence on the impact of the MedDiet on human health, assessing its effect on the incidence or progression of the main non-communicable diseases and their intermediate outcomes and risk factors. We scrutinised the clinical evidence from observational studies and randomised controlled trials. Cardiovascular disease was the condition with most information. The MedDiet showed a general preventive effect, which was reproduced to varying degrees for certain intermediate cardiovascular outcomes such as blood pressure, lipids, obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Benefits were also found for several types of cancer, brain function (including cognition, mood and to a lesser extent Parkinson's disease) and mortality. The quality of the published evidence was, however, generally moderate or low. In conclusion, the MedDiet shows a favourable impact on health. General adoption of a MedDiet is concordant with current policies promoting healthy and sustainable nutrition worldwide. Nonetheless, more high-quality research is needed to improve the consistency of the findings.},

Healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet (MD), may decrease the markers of LGI. Healthy Nordic diet (HND) has many similarities with MD, but its effects on LGI are less well known. Both of these dietary patterns emphasize the abundant use of fruits and vegetables (and berries in HND), whole grain products, fish, and vegetable oil (canola oil in HND and olive oil in MD), but restrict the use of saturated fat and red and processed meat. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize the results of studies, which have investigated the associations or effects of HND on the markers of LGI. Altogether, only two publications of observational studies and eight publications of intervention trials were found through the literature search. Both observational studies reported an inverse association between the adherence to HND and concentration of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). A significant decrease in the concentration of hsCRP was reported in two out of four intervention studies measuring hsCRP. Single intervention studies reported the beneficial effects on interleukin 1Ra and Cathepsin S. Current evidence suggests the beneficial effects on LGI with HND, but more carefully controlled studies are needed to confirm the anti-inflammatory effects of the HND.},

abstract = {The possible therapeutic impact of dietary changes on existing mental illness is largely unknown. Using a randomised controlled trial design, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of a dietary improvement program for the treatment of major depressive episodes. ‘SMILES' was a 12-week, parallel-group, single blind, randomised controlled trial of an adjunctive dietary intervention in the treatment of moderate to severe depression. The intervention consisted of seven individual nutritional consulting sessions delivered by a clinical dietician. The control condition comprised a social support protocol to the same visit schedule and length. Depression symptomatology was the primary endpoint, assessed using the Montgomery–{\AA}sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included remission and change of symptoms, mood and anxiety. Analyses utilised a likelihood-based mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The robustness of estimates was investigated through sensitivity analyses. We assessed 166 individuals for eligibility, of whom 67 were enrolled (diet intervention, n = 33; control, n = 34). Of these, 55 were utilising some form of therapy: 21 were using psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy combined; 9 were using exclusively psychotherapy; and 25 were using only pharmacotherapy. There were 31 in the diet support group and 25 in the social support control group who had complete data at 12 weeks. The dietary support group demonstrated significantly greater improvement between baseline and 12 weeks on the MADRS than the social support control group, t(60.7) = 4.38, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = –1.16. Remission, defined as a MADRS score <10, was achieved for 32.3% (n = 10) and 8.0% (n = 2) of the intervention and control groups, respectively ($\chi$\r\n \r\n 2\r\n (1) = 4.84, p = 0.028); number needed to treat (NNT) based on remission scores was 4.1 (95% CI of NNT 2.3–27.8). A sensitivity analysis, testing departures from the missing at random (MAR) assumption for dropouts, indicated that the impact of the intervention was robust to violations of MAR assumptions.

abstract = {Objective: The study objective was to assess the efficacy of problem-solving therapy for primary care (PST-PC) for preventing episodes of major depression and mitigating depressive symptoms of older black and white adults. The comparison group received dietary coaching. Methods: A total of 247 participants (90 blacks, 154 whites, and three Asians) with subsyndromal depressive symptoms were recruited into a randomized depression prevention trial that compared effects of individually delivered PST-PC and dietary coaching on time to major depressive episode and level of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) over two years. Cumulative intervention time averaged 5.526.0 hours in each study arm. Results: The two groups did not differ significantly in time to major depressive episodes, and incidence of such episodes was low (blacks, N=8, 9%; whites, N=13, 8%), compared with published rates of 20%-25% over one year among persons with subsyndromal symptoms and receiving care as usual. Participants also showed a mean decrease of 4 points in depressive symptoms, sustained over two years. Despite greater burden of depression risk factors among blacks, no significant differences from whites were found in the primary outcome. Conclusions: Both PST-PC and dietary coaching are potentially effective in protecting older black and white adults with subsyndromal depressive symptoms from developing episodes of major depression over two years. Absent a control for concurrent usual care, this conclusion is preliminary. If confirmed, both interventions hold promise as scalable, safe, nonstigmatizing interventions for delaying or preventing episodes of major depression in the nation's increasingly diverse older population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is supposed to be associated with an unhealthy lifestyle including poor diet. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in diet quality between patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression and population-based controls. Additionally, we aimed to examine effects of specific depression characteristics on diet by analyzing if diet quality varies between patients with distinct depression subtypes, and if depression severity is associated with diet quality.\n\nMETHODS: The study included 1660 participants from the BiDirect Study (n = 840 patients with depression, n = 820 population-based controls). The psychiatric assessment was based on clinical interviews and a combination of depression scales in order to provide the classification of depression subtypes and severity. Diet quality scores, reflecting the adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, were calculated on the basis of an 18-item food frequency questionnaire. Using analysis of covariance, we calculated adjusted means of diet quality scores and tested differences between groups (adjusted for socio-demographic, lifestyle-, and health-related factors).\n\nRESULTS: We found no differences in diet quality between controls and patients with depression if depression was considered as one entity. However, we did find differences between patients with distinct subtypes of depression. Patients with melancholic depression reported the highest diet quality scores, whereas patients with atypical depression reported the lowest scores. Depression severity was not associated with diet quality.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Previous literature has commonly treated depression as a homogeneous entity. However, subtypes of depression may be associated with diet quality in different ways. Further studies are needed to enlighten the diet-depression relationship and the role of distinct depression subtypes.},

Anthropometric measurements, some biochemical parameters, demographic data, and 24-hour dietary recall were evaluated. Results. 65.5% of depression and 60.0% of control group were female. Intake of vitamins A, thiamine, riboflavin, B6, folate, C, Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Fe, Zn, and fibre (p<0.05) were lower in depression group. Median levels of body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio (p<0.05) were significantly higher in depression group. Fasting blood glucose levels, serum vitamins B12, and folic acid (p<0.05) in depression group were lower than controls. Serum insulin and HOMA levels of two groups were similar. Conclusion. Some vitamin B consumption and serum vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were low while signs of abdominal obesity were high among patients with depression. Future research exploring nutritional status of individuals with depression is warranted.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTGut microbiomes may have a significant impact on mood and cognition, which is leading experts towards a new frontier in neuroscience. Studies have shown that increase in the amount of good bacteria in the gut can curb inflammation and cortisol level, reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, lowers stress reactivity, improves memory and even lessens neuroticism and social anxiety. This shows that, probably the beneficial gut bacteria or probiotics function mechanistically as delivery vehicles for neuroactive compounds. Thus, a psychobiotic is a live organism, when ingested in adequate amounts, produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric illness. Study of these novel class of probiotics may open up the possibility of rearrangement of intestinal microbiota for effective management of various psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the relation between the consumption or avoidance of meat and psychological health and well-being. Methods: A systematic search of online databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, Medline, and Cochrane Library) was conducted for primary research examining psychological health in meat-consumers and meat-abstainers. Inclusion criteria were the provision of a clear distinction between meat-consumers and meat-abstainers, and data on factors related to psychological health. Studies examining meat consumption as a continuous or multi-level variable were excluded. Summary data were compiled, and qualitative analyses of methodologic rigor were conducted. The main outcome was the disparity in the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and related conditions in meat-consumers versus meat-abstainers. Secondary outcomes included mood and self-harm behaviors. Results: Eighteen studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria; representing 160,257 participants (85,843 females and 73,232 males) with 149,559 meat-consumers and 8584 meat-abstainers (11 to 96 years) from multiple geographic regions. Analysis of methodologic rigor revealed that the studies ranged from low to severe risk of bias with high to very low confidence in results. Eleven of the 18 studies demonstrated that meat-abstention was associated with poorer psychological health, four studies were equivocal, and three showed that meat-abstainers had better outcomes. The most rigorous studies demonstrated that the prevalence or risk of depression and/or anxiety were significantly greater in participants who avoided meat consumption. Conclusion: Studies examining the relation between the consumption or avoidance of meat and psychological health varied substantially in methodologic rigor, validity of interpretation, and confidence in results. The majority of studies, and especially the higher quality studies, showed that those who avoided meat consumption had significantly higher rates or risk of depression, anxiety, and/or self-harm behaviors. There was mixed evidence for temporal relations, but study designs and a lack of rigor precluded inferences of causal relations. Our study does not support meat avoidance as a strategy to benefit psychological health.},

Patients (n=119) referred by general practitioners to the 12-week randomised controlled trial were assigned to either an intervention of six visits to a dual qualified dietitian/exercise physiologist (DEP) where motivational interviewing and activity scheduling were used to engage patients in individually-tailored lifestyle change (focussed on diet and physical activity), or an attention control with scheduled telephone contact. Assessments conducted at baseline (n=94) and 12 weeks (n=60) were analysed with an intent-to-treat approach using linear mixed modelling. Significant improvement was found for both groups on Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) scores, measures of nutrient intake and total Australian modified Healthy Eating Index (Aust-HEI) scores. Significant differences between groups over time were found only for iron intake and body mass index. Patients participating in individual consultations with a dietitian were more likely to maintain or improve diet quality than those participating in an attention control. This study provides initial evidence to support the role of dietitians in the management of patients with depression and/or anxiety.},

Recent literature is represented by papers that examine overall diet by way of dietary patterns and its association with depression, replacing previous studies about nutrients. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the relation between dietary patterns and depressive episode in the baseline (2008–2010) population of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). We analyzed 14,798 participants of ELSA-Brasil. Methods: We constructed dietary patterns based on the Food Frequency Questionnaire using multiple correspondence and cluster analysis; to evaluate depressive episodes, we used the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R). As an independent variable, we used the patterns: Traditional, Low-Sugar/Low-Fat, Fruit-Vegetables, and Bakery Products. We used multiple logistic regression models to evaluate relations between the dietary patterns and depressive episodes. Results: The Traditional pattern showed the highest percentages of consumption. After adjusting, the Bakery Products (OR = 1.33; 95%CI 1.05–1.70) was associated positively and significantly with depressive episodes only for women. Conclusions: International studies corroborated this finding, suggesting that the Bakery Products pattern could be a marker of a specific population group in which depressive episodes are frequent.},

The objective of this study is to analyze the relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and the intake of specific foods in primary care patients aged 45 to 75, having subclinical or major depression. The study also specifically analyzes this relationship in individuals suffering from chronic diseases. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. 3062 subjects met the inclusion criteria from the EIRA study. Sociodemographic variables, clinical morbidity, depression symptomatology (PHQ-9) and adherence to Mediterranean diet (MEDAS) were collected. Results: Being female, younger, with a higher BMI, consuming more than 1 serving of redmeat a day and drinking more than one carbonated or sugary drink daily, not consuming 3 servings of nuts a week and not eating 2 vegetables cooked in olive oil a week are predictors of having higher depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: Assessing the type of diet of patients presenting depressive symptoms and promoting adherence to a healthy diet is important, especially in patients with chronic diseases. However, depression is a very complex issue and the relationship between nutrition and depression must be further examined.},

Design: Cross-sectional survey in a nationally representative sample of mid-aged women participating in a cohort study. Subjects: Data from 9,895 women aged 50–55 who participated in the 2001 survey and had four or less missing values on their food frequency questionnaires were used to calculate the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS) based on adherence to Australian Dietary Guidelines. Measure of Outcome: Correlates of ARFS were investigated including, mean nutrient intakes and indices of self-rated health and health service use. Associations were examined using ANOVA for continuous variables and Chi-squared tests for categorical variables. Area of residence and educational attainment were used as covariates in all modeling, to adjust for sampling frame and socioeconomic status. Results: The maximum ARFS was 74, with a mean of 33.0 ± 9.0 and 21% achieving a score > 40. Higher ARFS was associated with indicators of higher socio-economic status, better self-rated health and lower health service use, p<0.0001, higher intakes of micronutrients and lower percentage of energy as total or saturated fat, p<0.0001. Conclusions: The Australian Recommended Food Score can be used to rank mid-aged women in terms of diet quality and nutrient intake and is associated with indices of self-rated health and health service use. The ARFS can be used to measure future associations with health outcomes and mortality. {\textcopyright} 2008 American College of Nutrition.},

abstract = {Depression is a leading cause of disability, yet current prevention and treatment approaches have only had modest effects. It is important to better understand the role of dietary patterns on depressive symptoms, which may help prevent depression or complement current treatments. This study examined whether adherence to a Mediterranean diet (Med Diet), determined by the Alternate Med Diet score (aMED), was associated with depressive symptoms in a representative sample of U.S. adults. The aMED score (range 0–9) was calculated from a 24-h diet recall with gender-specific quartiles (Q) estimated. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to define depressive symptoms, which was dichotomized as no to mild (0–9) versus moderate to severe symptoms (10–27). Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between quartiles of aMED and depressive symptoms when controlling for sociodemographics, total calories, and the time of year of diet recall; 7.9% of the sample had moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Compared to individuals with the lowest aMED (Q1), individuals in Q3 and Q4 had 40% and 45% lower odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.50, 0.74; OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.84, respectively). This study provides modest support of Med Diet's role in supporting positive mental health.},

abstract = {Background: Data on the association between dietary patterns and depression are scarce. The objective of this study was to examine the longitudinal association between dietary patterns and depressive symptoms assessed repeatedly over 10 years in the French occupational GAZEL cohort. Methods: A total of 9,272 men and 3,132 women, aged 45-60 years in 1998, completed a 35-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline. Dietary patterns were derived by Principal Component Analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) in 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. The main outcome measure was the repeated measures of CES-D. Longitudinal analyses were performed with logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations. Principal Findings: The highest quartile of low-fat, western, high snack and high fat-sweet diets in men and low-fat and high snack diets in women were associated with higher likelihood of depressive symptoms at the start of the follow-up compared to the lowest quartile (OR between 1.16 and 1.50). Conversely, the highest quartile of traditional diet (characterized by fish and fruit consumption) was associated with a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms in women compared to the lowest quartile, with OR = 0.63 [95%CI, 0.50 to 0.80], as the healthy pattern (characterized by vegetables consumption) with OR = 0.72 [95%CI, 0.63 to 0.83] and OR = 0.75 [95%CI, 0.61 to 0.93] in men and women, respectively. However, there was probably a reverse causality effect for the healthy pattern. Conclusion: This longitudinal study shows that several dietary patterns are associated with depressive symptoms and these associations track over time. {\textcopyright} 2012 Le Port et al.},

abstract = {Objective Psychological disorders are highly prevalent worldwide. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between major dietary patterns and prevalence of psychological disorders in a large sample of Iranian adults. Design A cross-sectional study was done to identify dietary patterns derived from factor analysis. Dietary data were collected through the use of a validated dish-based semi-quantitative FFQ. Psychological health was examined by use of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the General Health Questionnaire. Setting The study was conducted in Isfahan, Iran, within the framework of the Study on Epidemiology of Psychological, Alimentary Health and Nutrition (SEPAHAN). Subjects Iranian adults (n 3846) aged 20-55 years. Results After adjustment for potential confounders, greater adherence to the lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern was protectively associated with depression in women (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}65; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}46, 0{\textperiodcentered}91). Normal-weight participants in the top quintile of this dietary pattern tended to have decreased odds of anxiety compared with those in the bottom quintile (OR=0{\textperiodcentered}61; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}38, 1{\textperiodcentered}00). In addition, the traditional dietary pattern was associated with increased odds of depression (OR=1{\textperiodcentered}42; 95 % CI 1{\textperiodcentered}01, 1{\textperiodcentered}99) and anxiety (OR=1{\textperiodcentered}56; 95 % CI 1{\textperiodcentered}00, 2{\textperiodcentered}42) in women. Normal-weight participants in the highest quintile of the traditional dietary pattern had greater odds for anxiety (OR=1{\textperiodcentered}89; 95 % CI 1{\textperiodcentered}12, 3{\textperiodcentered}08) compared with those in the lowest quintile. The Western dietary pattern was associated with increased odds of depression in men (OR=1{\textperiodcentered}73; 95 % CI 1{\textperiodcentered}07, 2{\textperiodcentered}81) and anxiety in normal-weight participants (OR=2{\textperiodcentered}05; 95 % CI 1{\textperiodcentered}22, 3{\textperiodcentered}46). There was a significant increasing trend in the odds of psychological distress across increasing quintiles of the fast food dietary pattern in women (P-trend=0{\textperiodcentered}02). Conclusions Recommendation to increase the intake of fruits, citrus fruits, vegetables, tomato and low-fat dairy products and to reduce the intakes of snacks, high-fat dairy products, chocolate, carbonated drinks, sweets and desserts might be associated with lower chance of psychological disorders.},

It is generally based on the daily intake of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, fish, white meats, and olive oil. It may also include moderate consumption of fermented dairy products, a low intake of red meat, and red/white wine during the main course. Even if the effect of MD on cancer prevention as well as on human metabolic and cardiovascular balance has been discussed, including the quality of life of the exposed population, the putative effects on mental health are still not properly investigated. This narrative review reports on some emerging pieces of evidence on the possible impact of MD on general health and the outcome of psychiatric disorders (e.g., major depression, anxiety) and encourages further studies to test the benefits of healthy food selection on the health of the general population.},

abstract = {This study examines the role of anxiety and depression symptoms in predicting dietary choices in emerging adults while accounting for sex differences in these relationships. Participants were 225 English speaking undergraduates enrolled in a university in southeastern United States. Participants were recruited through an online research recruitment application utilized by the university. Participants volunteered for a two-phased anonymous survey monitoring the effects of eating habits and gastrointestinal health in young adults. As part of this effort, participants completed self-reporting measures related to anxiety and depression, as well as an automated, self-administered 24-h diet recall. Multigroup path analysis was used to test primary hypotheses. Overall, a decrease in total caloric intake and an increase in sugar consumption were found as self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression increased. In addition, there were sex differences in the relationship between depression and food choices. Men consumed more saturated fat as well as less fruits and vegetables as self-reported symptoms of depression increased. Results suggest symptoms of depression are a greater risk factor for poor nutrition in male college students than females. The findings provide another justification to screen for psychological distress in student health services given the implications on behavioral lifestyle and health.},

A number of epidemiological studies have examined associations between dairy consumption and depressive symptoms, but results have been inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to examine whether an association exists between dairy consumption and depressive symptoms or disorders in adults. Anxiety symptoms were also explored as a secondary outcome. CINAHL, Cochrane, MEDLINE complete, EMBASE, Scopus and PsycINFO databases were searched from database inception to December 2018. Studies were included if they used a case-control, cross-sectional, or cohort study design, and included community dwelling or institutionalized adults (≥18 years). Seven prospective and six cross-sectional studies (N = 58,203 participants) reported on the association between dairy consumption and depressive symptoms or disorders. Findings were mixed, with one study reporting a positive association; five studies reporting no association; and seven studies reporting mixed associations depending on dairy type, gender or population group. We found conflicting and inconsistent associations in studies that were generally of fair quality.

Our best-evidence analyses found limited evidence to support an association between traditional diets (Mediterranean or Norwegian diets) and depression. We also observed a conflicting level of evidence for associations between (i) a traditional Japanese diet and depression, (ii) a "healthy" diet and depression, (iii) a Western diet and depression, and (iv) individuals with depression and the likelihood of eating a less healthy diet.\n\nCONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first review to synthesize and critically analyze evidence regarding diet quality, dietary patterns and depression. Further studies are urgently required to elucidate whether a true causal association exists.},

abstract = {AIM To investigate which foods are the most nutrient dense sources of nutrients demonstrated by the scientific literature to play a role in the prevention and promotion of recovery from depressive disorders. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted to derive a list of Antidepressant Nutrients from the 34 nutrients known to be essential for humans using level of evidence criteria. Nutritional data was extracted for a subset of foods with a high content of at least 1 Antidepressant Nutrient using a USDA database. These foods were analyzed for Antidepressant Nutrient density resulting in an Antidepressant Food Score (AFS). Plant and animal foods were analyzed separately. RESULTS Twelve Antidepressant Nutrients relate to the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders: Folate, iron, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), magnesium, potassium, selenium, thiamine, vitamin A, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and zinc. The highest scoring foods were bivalves such as oysters and mussels, various seafoods, and organ meats for animal foods. The highest scoring plant foods were leafy greens, lettuces, peppers, and cruciferous vegetables. CONCLUSION The AFS is based on a nutrient profiling system devised to identify foods with the highest nutrient density of nutrients with clinical evidence to support their role in depressive disorders. This list of foods and food categories with the highest density of the 12 Antidepressant Nutrients, the Antidepressant Foods, should be considered by researchers in the design of future intervention studies and clinicians as dietary options to support prevention and recovery from depression disorders.},

abstract = {In 21st-century public health, rapid urbanization and mental health disorders are a growing global concern. The relationship between diet, brain function and the risk of mental disorders has been the subject of intense research in recent years. In this review, we examine some of the potential socioeconomic and environmental challenges detracting from the traditional dietary patterns that might otherwise support positive mental health. In the context of urban expansion, climate change, cultural and technological changes and the global industrialization and ultraprocessing of food, findings related to nutrition and mental health are connected to some of the most pressing issues of our time. The research is also of relevance to matters of biophysiological anthropology. We explore some aspects of a potential evolutionary mismatch between our ancestral past (Paleolithic, Neolithic) and the contemporary nutritional environment. Changes related to dietary acid load, advanced glycation end products and microbiota (via dietary choices and cooking practices) may be of relevance to depression, anxiety and other mental disorders. In particular, the results of emerging studies demonstrate the importance of prenatal and early childhood dietary practices within the developmental origins of health and disease concept. There is still much work to be done before these population studies and their mirrored advances in bench research can provide translation to clinical medicine and public health policy. However, the clear message is that in the midst of a looming global epidemic, we ignore nutrition at our peril.},

Severe mental illnesses (SMI), including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, are associated with increased inflammation. Given diet's role in modulating inflammatory processes, excessive calorie-dense, nutrient-deficient processed food intake may contribute toward the heightened inflammation observed in SMI. This review assesses the evidence from observational and experimental studies to investigate how diet may affect physical and mental health outcomes in SMI through inflammation-related pathways. Cross-sectional studies indicate that individuals with SMI, particularly schizophrenia, consume more pro-inflammatory foods and fewer anti-inflammatory nutrients than the general population. Cohort studies indicate that high levels of dietary inflammation are associated with increased risk of developing depression, but there is currently a lack of evidence for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Randomized controlled trials show that dietary interventions improve symptoms of depression, but none have tested the extent to which these benefits are due to changes in inflammation. This review summarizes evidence on dietary inflammation in SMI, explores the directionality of these links, and discusses the potential use of targeted nutritional interventions for improving psychological well-being and physical health outcomes in SMI. Establishing the extent to which diet explains elevated levels of inflammatory markers observed in SMI is a priority for future research.},

Findings highlight the potential importance of the relationship between dietary patterns or quality and mental health early in the life span. (Am J},

abstract = {Earlier studies have shown a protective association between adherence to healthy eating guidelines and mental disorders in Western nations; however, data in this regard are limited from the understudied region of Middle East. We examined the association between adherence to healthy eating guidelines, as measured by Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010, and prevalence of anxiety and depression in a large sample of Iranian adults. In this cross-sectional study, data on dietary intakes of 3363 adult participants were collected using a validated dish-based 106-item semi-quantitative FFQ. Adherence to healthy eating was quantified using AHEI-2010, as suggested by earlier publications. The Iranian validated version of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression in study participants. Data on other covariates were gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire. Overall, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 15{\textperiodcentered}2 % (males 10{\textperiodcentered}8 % and females 18{\textperiodcentered}3 %) and 30{\textperiodcentered}0 % (males 22{\textperiodcentered}9 % and females 35{\textperiodcentered}1 %), respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, those in the top quartile of AHEI-2010 had a 49 % lower chance of anxiety (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}51; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}35, 0{\textperiodcentered}72) and a 45 % lower odds of depression (OR 0{\textperiodcentered}55; 95 % CI 0{\textperiodcentered}42, 0{\textperiodcentered}72), compared with those in the bottom quartile. Stratified analysis by sex revealed that women in the highest categories of AHEI-2010 had a 49 % lower odds of having anxiety and depression, after adjustment for confounders, but no significant association was found in men. In addition, among individuals who were 40 years old or younger, those with high adherence to AHEI-2010 were 58 and 51 % less likely to have anxiety and depression, compared with those with less adherence. Adherence to healthy eating was inversely associated with a lower chance of anxiety and depression in Iranian adults. Prospective studies are required to confirm these associations in Middle-Eastern populations.},

abstract = {Much of the attention on diet and Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cognition among the elderly has focused on the role of single nutrients or foods, while available information on dietary pattern (DP) analysis, which better reflects the complexity of the diet, is sparse. In this review, we describe different patterning approaches and present studies performed to date that have assessed the associations between DPs and risk of AD or cognitive function in the elderly. Three patterning approaches have been most commonly used: (i) hypothesis-based that use dietary quality indexes or scores (e.g. Mediterranean pattern), (ii) data-driven that use factor or cluster analysis to derive DPs, (iii) reduced rank regression which combines characteristics of the former two approaches. Despite differences existing among the approaches, DPs characterized by higher intake of fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts and legumes, and lower intake of meats, high fat dairy, and sweets seemed to be associated with lower odds of cognitive deficits or reduced risk of AD. Overall, the inherent advantages as well as the existing evidence of DP analyses strongly suggest that this approach may be valuable in AD and aging research. Further studies are warranted, though, to confirm the findings in different population settings, to address some methodological issues, and possibly utilize the information for future clinical trial design.},

abstract = {Background: Vegetarianism is linked with better physical health, but also to increased anxiety and depression. The aim of the present study is to examine the relationship between vegetarianism and both positive and negative mental health, across cultures and over time. Method: Self-report questionnaire data were obtained from a large-scale multi-national cross-sectional sample including 2007 representative adult members of the German population, 3020 representative adults from Russia, and 3038 representative adults from the USA. Participants for the longitudinal analyses include university students from Germany (1608) and China (12,744). Statistical models included multiple linear regression, longitudinal linear models and longitudinal logistic models. Results: Vegetarianism diet is not reliably related to positive or negative mental health in US and Russian representative samples or in German representative or student samples. Vegetarianism is related to slight increases over time in anxiety and depression in Chinese students. Conclusions: Vegetarianism is not associated with mental health in the US, Russia, or Germany, but is associated with anxiety and depression in China in this study. Future studies should examine the nuances of vegetarianism in more detail and their links with mental health, including dietary composition and cultural beliefs and economic circumstances. Future researchers in this area may also want to consider the effects of experimental manipulation of diet on mental health outcomes over time.},

abstract = {It has been reported that a Mediterranean-type diet in old age is protective against inflammation in Italians with depressive symptoms. In the present study, we explore this hypothesis in a non-Mediterranean, elderly sample, and further disentangle whether it is a Mediterranean diet . per se or a healthy diet, in general, that confers this protective effect. The sample is a cohort of people born in 1936, who were assessed on diet and depressive symptoms at age 70. Inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and albumin, were collected at ages 70 and 73, while Interleukin-6 transferrin and ferritin were measured at the second time-point only. Controlling for confounding factors (e.g., CVD risk factors, medication) no interaction effect of depressive symptoms and Mediterranean diet was observed on inflammation. However, a main effect of Mediterranean diet on change in C-reactive protein was significant (. $\beta$=. -0.10, . p=. 0.03), and so too was an effect of the 'Health Aware' diet on ferritin (. $\beta$=. -0.12, . p=. 0.02). An interaction between depressive symptoms and a Health Aware diet on transferrin levels showed that there was an association between increased depressive symptoms and inflammation in those following a Health Aware diet. Our results indicate that there are advantages of a Mediterranean diet over a Health Aware diet with respect to the progression of inflammation in old age and that depressive symptoms compound inflammatory burden only for specific biomarkers and under specific dietary conditions unrelated to the Mediterranean diet. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we first review recent empirical evidence of the association between several micronutrients—zinc, magnesium, selenium—and depression. We then present potential mechanisms of action and discuss the clinical implications for each micronutrient. Collectively, empirical evidence most strongly supports a positive association between zinc deficiency and the risk of depression and an inverse association between zinc supplementation and depressive symptoms. Less evidence is available regarding the relationship between magnesium and selenium deficiency and depression, and studies have been inconclusive. Potential mechanisms of action involve the HPA axis, glutamate homeostasis and inflammatory pathways. Findings support the importance of adequate consumption of micronutrients in the promotion of mental health, and the most common dietary sources for zinc and other micronutrients are provided. Future research is needed to prospectively investigate the association between micronutrient levels and depression as well as the safety and efficacy of micronutrient supplementation as an adjunct treatment for depression.},

abstract = {Context: Serotonergic dysfunction, including reduced central serotonin levels, is associated with different psychiatric syndromes, including depression. As a serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan has long been used as a nonpharmacological treatment for depression. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the antidepressant effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan in depressed patients. Data sources: MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Google Scholar were searched from inception to May 2018. Data extraction: Thirteen investigations were included in the systematic review (using PRISMA guidelines), and 7 in the full meta-analysis (pre-registered on PROSPERO: CRD42018104415). Data analysis: Analyses revealed a depression remission rate of 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.78; remission rate [k]= 13), and this was confirmed by the questionnaire results, which revealed a large Hedges' g (1.11; 95%CI, 0.53-1.69). Methodological variability (in treatment duration, type of depression studied, experimental design, 5-hydroxytryptophan dosage) contributes to heterogeneity in the results (I2 = 76%, s2 = 0.379). In addition, the OHAT (Office of Health Assessment and Translation risk of bias rating) tool suggested that, on the whole, current studies are relatively weak (few include placebo groups). Conclusion: Further trials should overcome these limitations by using placebo-controlled studies that include patients with well-defined depression diagnoses, along with strong characterization of psychological and physiological patient characteristics.},

Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to investigate the effect of saffron supplementation, as both an adjunctive therapy and monotherapy, on symptoms of depression and anxiety in clinical and general populations compared with pharmacotherapy or placebo. Data sources: Using the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials was conducted. Data extraction: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine treatment effect. Risk of bias was assessed using the Jadad scale. Results: Twenty-three studies were included.

Saffron also had a large positive effect size when used as an adjunct to antidepressants for depressive symptoms (g = 1.23, P = 0.028). Egger's regression test found evidence of publication bias. Conclusions: Saffron could be an effective intervention for symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, due to evidence of publication bias and lack of regional diversity, further trials are required.

abstract = {Depression and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are highly comorbid disorders that carry a large public health burden. However, there is a clear lack of knowledge of the neural pathological pathways underlying these illnesses. The present study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which a diet rich in fat can cause multiple complications in the brain, thereby affecting intracellular signaling and gene expression that underlie anxiety and depressive behaviors. The results show that a high-fat diet (HFD; ∼16 weeks) causes anxiety and anhedonic behaviors. Importantly, the results also show that 4 months of HFD causes disruption of intracellular cascades involved in synaptic plasticity and insulin signaling/glucose homeostasis (ie, Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), P70S6K), as well as increased corticosterone levels and activation of the innate immune system, including elevation of inflammatory cytokines (ie, IL-6, IL-1$\beta$, TNF$\alpha$). Interestingly, the rapid acting antidepressant ketamine reverses the behavioral deficits caused by HFD and activates ERK and P70S6 kinase signaling in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, we found that pharmacological blockade of the innate immune inflammasome system by repeated administration of an inhibitor of the purinergic P2X7 receptor blocks the anxiety caused by HFD. Together these studies further elucidate the signaling pathways that underlie chronic HFD exposure on anxiety and depressive behaviors, and identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with metabolic disorder or T2D who suffer from anxiety and depression.},

abstract = {Depression affects 8% of adults in America and is one of the leading causes of disability in Western countries. The dietary inflammatory index (DII) has previously been reported to be associated with inflammation and depression. However, no study to date has looked at the potential mediating effect of inflammation on the association of DII and depression. We hypothesized that the association of DII and depression would be both statistically and clinically mediated substantially by inflammation. We assessed these associations using the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010 database. Our analysis included 10,022 participants aged 20 years and older. Inflammation was assessed with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Diet was measured using two 24 hour dietary recalls. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which has a score range of 0 to 27, with the higher score showing more severe depressive symptoms. Comparing the highest to lowest DII quartiles, the mean score difference for depression was 0.47 units (95% CI 0.24-0.70, P-trend <.001) in the multivariable adjusted model. In the sex-stratified models, the results remained significant only among females, with the mean score difference of 0.72 (95% CI 0.34-1.10, P-trend <.001). CRP mediated 3.6% of the association between DII and depression in the total population in the fully adjusted model, which was statistically significant (P-trend <.001) but not clinically significant. No mediation association was found in the sex-stratified models. Further studies are needed to assess the associations with various inflammatory biomarkers in larger and more diverse populations.},

Results: After taking potential confounders into account, participants in the highest quartile of the MIND diet score had a lower odds of depression (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53–0.89) and psychological distress (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52–0.89) than those in the lowest quartile. No significant association was observed between consumption of MIND diet and odds of anxiety (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.51–1.03). When we did gender-stratified analyses, no significant association was seen between adherence to the MIND diet and odds of psychological disorders in men; however, women in the top quartile of the MIND diet score had lower odds of depression (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45–0.81) and psychological distress (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48–0.90) than those in the bottom quartile. Conclusion: We found that greater adherence to the MIND diet was inversely associated with odds of depression and psychological distress. No significant association was observed between consumption of MIND diet and odds of anxiety.},

The evidence for interactions between dietary fat and gut microbiota has been mostly derived from animal studies, but there is now also evidence emerging from human studies. We will review the current literature on how dietary fat influences the gut microbiota, particularly focusing on the type of fat. Mechanisms detailing how this crosstalk may impact on host metabolism and health will also be discussed. Some studies have reported somewhat controversial findings and therefore we will evaluate critically which possible aspects should be considered when interpreting current and planning further studies to explore the diet-microbiota crosstalk and its metabolic and clinical implications for the host.},

The objective of this metareview was to examine evidence across a broad range of CAM and lifestyle interventions in the treatment of anxiety disorders. In early 2012 we conducted a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library, for key studies, systematic reviews, and metaanalyses in the area. Our paper found that in respect to treatment of generalized anxiety or specific disorders, CAM evidence revealed current support for the herbal medicine Kava. One isolated study shows benefit for naturopathic medicine, whereas acupuncture, yoga, and Tai chi have tentative supportive evidence, which is hampered by overall poor methodology. The breadth of evidence does not support homeopathy for treating anxiety. Strong support exists for lifestyle modifications including adoption of moderate exercise and mindfulness meditation, whereas dietary improvement, avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine offer encouraging preliminary data. In conclusion, certain lifestyle modifications and some CAMs may provide a beneficial role in the treatment of anxiety disorders.},

abstract = {Background: Depression is a major global health burden and psychiatry requires evidence-based primary prevention and treatment strategies. Evidence suggests that certain dietary patterns, in particular, components of the Mediterranean diet, possess key biological factors associated with abating depressive risk and disease progression. We sought to evaluate the existing evidence regarding the association between the Mediterranean diet and depressive symptoms by conducting a systematic review. Methods: A search of published studies was conducted using the computer databases Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Scopus and Google Scholar, for articles in the English language published from inception to April 2018. The search strategy applied the following subject headings and keywords: “Mediterranean diet” OR Mediterranean* AND “Major depressive disorder” OR Depress* OR “Negative mood” OR Mood. The NIH quality assessment tool was implemented by reviewers to determine study quality. Results: Results from twenty observational studies and six intervention trials were qualitatively examined. The majority (85%) of observational studies support the evidence that the Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated with reductions in depressive incidence and all intervention studies echoed these findings. Limitations: Methodological disparity in Mediterranean style diets limited comparisons but were overcome by specifying inclusion criteria and compressive appraisal of the data. Conclusions: Modifying diet provides a potential treatment for depression which procures few side effects, lessens disease progression and demonstrates a cost-effective measure that can be implemented globally. Present research has found that more objective measures are necessary to define the Mediterranean diet and highlights the need for longitudinal studies and clinical trials for future research.},

abstract = {Background: Recent meta-analyses confirm a relationship between diet quality and both depression and cognitive health in adults. While the biological pathways that underpin these relationships are likely multitudinous, extensive evidence from animal studies points to the involvement of the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to examine the association between dietary patterns and hippocampal volume in humans, and to assess whether diet was associated with differential rates of hippocampal atrophy over time. Methods: Data were drawn from the Personality and Total Health Through Life Study and focused on a subsample of the cohort (n = 255) who were aged 60-64 years at baseline in 2001, completed a food frequency questionnaire, and underwent two magnetic resonance imaging scans approximately 4 years apart. Longitudinal generalized estimating equation linear regression models were used to assess the association between dietary factors and left and right hippocampal volumes over time. Results: Every one standard deviation increase in healthy "prudent" dietary pattern was associated with a 45.7 mm<sup>3</sup> (standard error 22.9 mm<sup>3</sup>) larger left hippocampal volume, while higher consumption of an unhealthy "Western" dietary pattern was (independently) associated with a 52.6 mm<sup>3</sup> (SE 26.6 mm<sup>3</sup>) smaller left hippocampal volume. These relationships were independent of covariates including age, gender, education, labour-force status, depressive symptoms and medication, physical activity, smoking, hypertension and diabetes. While hippocampal volume declined over time, there was no evidence that dietary patterns influenced this decline. No relationships were observed between dietary patterns and right hippocampal volume. Conclusions: Lower intakes of nutrient-dense foods and higher intakes of unhealthy foods are each independently associated with smaller left hippocampal volume. To our knowledge, this is the first human study to demonstrate associations between diet and hippocampal volume concordant with data previously observed in animal models.},

abstract = {Objective: This study examines the association of depressive and anxiety disorders and their clinical characteristics (disorder type, severity, chronicity and clinical subtypes) with diet quality. Method: Data from 1634 adults (controls = 336, current disorder = 414, remitted = 886) were sourced from the 9-year follow-up of the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Depressive and anxiety disorders were established with Composite International Diagnostic Interviews. Severity was measured with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS), Fear Questionnaire and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Chronicity was measured with life-chart interviews expressed as percentage time with a disorder(s). Diet quality was evaluated using the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI). Results: Diet quality was significantly worse among subjects with a current disorder than among healthy controls. Subdividing subjects showed that those with concurrent depressive and anxiety disorders had the lowest diet quality score (MDS: $\beta$ = −0.41 per SD, 95% Confidence interval (95%CI) = -0.60, −0.21; AHEI $\beta$ = −0.22 per SD 95% CI = −0.42,-0.03). More chronic depression or anxiety disorders and increased severity in all participants showed a dose-response association with poorer diet quality. There was no distinct pattern between IDS items related to depression subtypes and diet quality. Conclusion: Diet quality is poorer in persons with depressive and anxiety disorders; in particular in those with comorbidity. The more severe and chronic the symptoms, the poorer the diet quality. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the direction of the relationship of depressive and anxiety disorders with diet quality and to examine whether improving diet quality could improve mental health.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Vegetarian and vegan diets are increasing in popularity. Although they  provide beneficial health effects, they may also lead to nutritional deficiencies. Cognitive impairment and mental health disorders have a high economic burden. OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between vegan or vegetarian diets and cognitive and mental health. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Proquest databases were examined from inception to July 2018. STUDY SELECTION: Original observational or interventional human studies of vegan/vegetarian diets were selected independently by 2 authors. DATA EXTRACTION: Raw means and standard deviations were used as continuous outcomes, while numbers of events were used as categorical outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1249 publications identified, 13 were included, with 17 809 individuals in total. No significant association was found between diet and the continuous depression score, stress, well-being, or cognitive impairment. Vegans/vegetarians were at increased risk for depression (odds ratio = 2.142; 95%CI, 1.105-4.148) and had lower anxiety scores (mean difference = -0.847; 95%CI, -1.677 to -0.018). Heterogeneity was large, and thus subgroup analyses showed numerous differences. CONCLUSIONS: Vegan or vegetarian diets were related to a higher risk of depression and lower anxiety scores, but no differences for other outcomes were found. Subgroup analyses of anxiety showed a higher risk of anxiety, mainly in participants under 26 years of age and in studies with a higher quality. More studies with better overall quality are needed to make clear positive or negative associations. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no. CRD42018097204.},

abstract = {Obesity is an increasing problem in young people. Childhood obesity and overweight have increased rapidly on a global scale, and have tripled in the past 30 years, to affect approximately one in five children. Diets high in refined fats and sugar are a major contributor to the development of obesity, and the effects of such obesity-inducing hypercaloric diets on brain function may contribute to the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in people with obesity. Anxiety disorders typically emerge in childhood and adolescence, and symptoms often continue into adulthood. Based on this symptomology, we consider anxiety-related behavioral consequences of hypercaloric diets across development. We review research on the effects of hypercaloric dietary manipulations across the lifespan on emotion regulation and the neurobiological mechanisms that underpin these processes. Cumulatively, the findings reveal that gestation and the juvenile/adolescent developmental periods may be early-life windows of vulnerability for developing anxiety in later life due to the augmented effects of these diets on neuroendocrine stress systems and the maturation of neural circuitry supporting emotion regulation.},

abstract = {While maternal nutrition during pregnancy is known to play a critical role in the health of both mother and offspring, the magnitude of this association has only recently been realized. Novel, epigenetic data suggest that maternal dietary intake has permanent phenotypic consequences for offspring, highlighting the potency of antenatal diet. To date, the relationship between poor antenatal diet and maternal mental health specifically, remains poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review evidence that has examined associations between antenatal diet quality and the experience of depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms during the perinatal period. Methods: A search for peer-reviewed papers was conducted using Medline Complete, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Academic Search Premiere and Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection. Results: Nine studies (cohort = 4, cross-sectional = 5) published between 2005 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion in this review. A synthesis of findings revealed positive associations between poor quality and unhealthy diets and antenatal depressive and stress symptoms. Healthy diets were inversely associated with antenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms. Postnatal depressive symptoms demonstrated inconsistent results. Conclusions: Given the paucity of research examining diet quality and mental health in women during the perinatal period, further sufficiently powered studies are urgently required to examine this association.},

abstract = {Psychiatry is at an important juncture, with the current pharmacologically focused model having achieved modest benefits in addressing the burden of poor mental health worldwide. Although the determinants of mental health are complex, the emerging and compelling evidence for nutrition as a crucial factor in the high prevalence and incidence of mental disorders suggests that diet is as important to psychiatry as it is to cardiology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology. Evidence is steadily growing for the relation between dietary quality (and potential nutritional deficiencies) and mental health, and for the select use of nutrient-based supplements to address deficiencies, or as monotherapies or augmentation therapies. We present a viewpoint from an international collaboration of academics (members of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research), in which we provide a context and overview of the current evidence in this emerging field of research, and discuss the future direction. We advocate recognition of diet and nutrition as central determinants of both physical and mental health.},

abstract = {Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental disorders. There is mounting evidence demonstrating the importance of nutrition in the development and progression of mental disorders such as depression; however, less is known about the role of nutrition in anxiety disorders. This scoping review sought to systematically map the existing literature on anxiety disorders and nutrition in order to identify associations between dietary factors and anxiety symptoms or disorder prevalence as well as identify gaps and opportunities for further research. The review followed estab-lished methodological approaches for scoping reviews. Due to the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) with artificial intelligence features was used. Studies reporting an association between a dietary constituent and anxiety symptoms or disorders were counted and presented in figures. A total of 55,914 unique results were identified. After a full-text review, 1541 articles met criteria for inclusion. Analysis revealed an association between less anxiety and more fruits and vegetables, omega-3 fatty acids, “healthy” dietary patterns, caloric restriction, breakfast consumption, ketogenic diet, broad-spectrum micronutrient supplementation, zinc, magnesium and selenium, probiotics, and a range of phytochemicals. Analysis revealed an association between higher levels of anxiety and high-fat diet, inadequate tryptophan and dietary protein, high intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates, and “unhealthy” dietary patterns. Results are limited by a large percentage of animal and observational studies. Only 10% of intervention studies involved participants with anxiety disorders, limiting the applicability of the findings. High quality intervention studies involving participants with anxiety disorders are warranted.},

abstract = {Purpose: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been associated with fewer depressive symptoms, however, it is unknown whether this is attributed to some or to all components. We examined the association between the individual food groups of the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS), in isolation and in combination, with depression and anxiety (symptom severity and diagnosis). Methods: Data from 1634 adults were available from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Eleven energy-adjusted food groups were created from a 238-item food frequency questionnaire. In regression analysis, these were associated in isolation and combination with (1) depressive and anxiety disorders (established with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview) (current disorder n = 414), and (2) depression and anxiety severity [measured with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Fear Questionnaire (FEAR)]. Results: Overall, the MDS score shows the strongest relationships with depression/anxiety [Diagnosis: odds ratio (OR) 0.77 per SD, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.66–0.90, IDS: standardised betas ($\beta$) − 0.13, 95% CI − 0.18, − 0.08] and anxiety (BAI: $\beta$ − 0.11, 95% CI − 0.16, − 0.06, FEAR: $\beta$ − 0.08, 95% CI − 0.13, − 0.03). Greater consumption of non-refined grains and vegetables was associated with lower depression and anxiety severity, whilst being a non-drinker was associated with higher symptom severity. Higher fruit and vegetable intake was associated with lower fear severity. Non-refined grain consumption was associated with lower odds and being a non-drinker with greater odds of current depression/anxiety disorders compared to healthy controls, these associations persisted after adjustment for other food groups (OR 0.82 per SD, 95% CI 0.71–0.96, OR 1.26 per SD 95% CI 1.08–1.46). Conclusion: We can conclude that non-refined grains, vegetables and alcohol intake appeared to be the driving variables for the associated the total MDS score and depression/anxiety. However, the combined effect of the whole diet remains important for mental health. It should be explored whether an increase consumption of non-refined grains and vegetables may help to prevent or reduce depression and anxiety.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2016. Background Healthy lifestyles prevent cardiovascular disease and are increasingly recognized in relation to mental health but longitudinal studies are limited. We examined bi-directional associations between mood disorders and healthy lifestyles in a cohort followed for 5 years. Method Participants were aged 26-36 years at baseline (2004-2006) and 31-41 years at follow-up (2009-2011). At follow-up, lifetime mood disorders (depression or dysthymia) were retrospectively diagnosed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. A five-item lifestyle score (comprising body mass index, non-smoking, alcohol consumption, leisure time physical activity and healthy diet) was measured at both time points. Linear and log multinomial regression determined if mood disorder before baseline predicted changes in lifestyle (n = 1041). Log binomial regression estimated whether lifestyle at baseline predicted new episodes of mood disorder (n = 1233). Covariates included age, sex, socio-economic position, parental and marital status, social support, major life events, cardiovascular disease history, and self-rated physical and mental health. Results A history of mood disorder before baseline predicted unfavourable trajectories of lifestyle over follow-up, including somewhat lower risk of improvement [relative risk (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-1.03] and greater risk of worsening (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.99-2.15) of lifestyle independent of confounding factors. Higher lifestyle scores at baseline were associated with a 22% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.95) reduced risk of first episodes of mood disorder, independent of confounding factors. Conclusions Healthy lifestyles and mood disorders are closely related. Our results suggest that healthy lifestyles may not only reduce cardiovascular disease but also promote mental health.},

abstract = {Objective: Key biological factors that influence the development of depression are modified by diet. This study examined the extent to which the highprevalence mental disorders are related to habitual diet in 1,046 women ages 20–93 years randomly selected from the population. Method: A diet quality score was derived from answers to a food frequency questionnaire, and a factor analysis identified habitual dietary patterns. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure psychological symptoms, and a structured clinical interview was used to assess current depressive and anxiety disorders. Results: After adjustments for age, socioeconomic status, education, and health behaviors, a “traditional” dietary pattern characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains was associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia and for anxiety disorders. A “western” diet of processed or fried foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer was associated with a higher GHQ-12 score. There was also an inverse association between diet quality score and GHQ- 12 score that was not confounded by age, socioeconomic status, education, or other health behaviors. Conclusions: These results demonstrate an association between habitual diet quality and the high-prevalence mental disorders, although reverse causality and confounding cannot be ruled out as explanations. Further prospective studies are warranted.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Non-pharmacological approaches to the treatment of depression and anxiety are of increasing importance, with emerging evidence supporting a role for lifestyle factors in the development of these disorders. Observational evidence supports a relationship between habitual diet quality and depression. Less is known about the causative effects of diet on mental health outcomes. Therefore a systematic review was undertaken of randomised controlled trials of dietary interventions that used depression and/or anxiety outcomes and sought to identify characteristics of programme success. DESIGN: A systematic search of the Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed and PyscInfo databases was conducted for articles published between April 1971 and May 2014. RESULTS: Of the 1274 articles identified, seventeen met eligibility criteria and were included. All reported depression outcomes and ten reported anxiety or total mood disturbance. Compared with a control condition, almost half (47%) of the studies observed significant effects on depression scores in favour of the treatment group. The remaining studies reported a null effect. Effective dietary interventions were based on a single delivery mode, employed a dietitian and were less likely to recommend reducing red meat intake, select leaner meat products or follow a low-cholesterol diet. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a high level of heterogeneity, we found some evidence for dietary interventions improving depression outcomes. However, as only one trial specifically investigated the impact of a dietary intervention in individuals with clinical depression, appropriately powered trials that examine the effects of dietary improvement on mental health outcomes in those with clinical disorders are required.},

abstract = {Given the reported health benefits of a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and delay in cognitive decline, we aimed to determine the level of adherence to a MedDiet using an 11-point scale and examine relationships with cognitive function and psychological well-being. Cross-sectional analyses were undertaken on data from 1183 Australian adults, aged 40-65. Food frequency questionnaires were used to calculate mean intakes of foods included in a MedDiet and foods typically consumed in an Australian diet. Outcome measures included self-reported cognitive failures, memory, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, general health and physical function. The majority of Australians (71.7%) had a medium adherence to a MedDiet pattern. Overall MedDiet adherence was not related to cognitive function. However, intakes of plant foods associated with a MedDiet were positively associated with physical function and general health, and negatively associated with trait anxiety, depression and perceived stress. A substantial proportion of the diet in this Australian sample came from foods not typically consumed in a MedDiet. This is a major limitation when attempting to compare MedDiet adherence in different populations. Global standardisation of serving sizes and food groups are required for adequate comparison. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We aimed to investigate the association between diet quality, dietary patterns, and the common mental disorders in Norwegian adults.\n\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 5731 population-based men and women aged 46 to 49 and 70 to 74 years. Habitual diet was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, and mental health was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n\nRESULTS: After adjustments for variables including age, education, income, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption, an a priori healthy diet quality score was inversely related to depression (odds ratio [OR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59-0.84) and anxiety (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.68-0.87) in women and to depression (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.70-0.99) in men.

abstract = {Background It has been claimed that the quality of a diet is associated with the incidence of depressive disorders. We sought to investigate the evidence for this claim. Methods Systematic searches were performed up to March 6th, 2017 in order to identify prospective cohort studies that reported on exposure to dietary patterns or food groups and the incidence of depression/depressive symptoms. Data from 24 independent cohorts (totalling 1,959,217 person-years) were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. Results Adherence to a high-quality diet, regardless of type (i.e., healthy/prudent or Mediterranean), was associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms over time (odds ratios ranged 0.64–0.78 in a linear dose-response fashion [P < 0.01]). A relatively low dietary inflammatory index was also associated with a somewhat lower incidence of depressive symptom (odds ratio = 0.81), although not in a dose-response fashion. Similar associations were found for the consumption of fish and vegetables (odds ratios 0.86 and 0.82 respectively) but not for other high quality food groups (e.g., fruit). Studies that controlled for depression severity at baseline or that used a formal diagnosis as outcome did not yield statistically significant findings. Adherence to low quality diets and food groups was not associated with higher depression incidence. Limitations Our ability to detect confounders was only limited. Conclusion There is evidence that a higher quality of a diet is associated with a lower risk for the onset of depressive symptoms, but not all available results are consistent with the hypothesis that diet influences depression risk. Prospective studies that control for relevant confounders such as obesity incidence and randomized controlled prevention trials are needed to increase the validity of findings in this field.},
